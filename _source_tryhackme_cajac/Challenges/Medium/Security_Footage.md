## Solution

Someone broke into our office last night, but they destroyed the hard drives with the security footage. Can you recover the footage?

Note: If you are using the AttackBox, you can find the task files inside the `/root/Rooms/securityfootage/` directory.

### Basic analysis of the file

We start with some basic analysis of the given file

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Medium/Security_Footage]
└─$ file security-footage.pcap

```

### Get an overview of the traffic

Next, we get an overview of the protocols included in the traffic:

```bash

└─$ tshark -q -z io,phs -r security-footage.pcap

Only HTTP-traffic. Let's dig deeper:

Only one HTTP GET-request...!?

A failed attempt was then made to `Export Object` -> `HTTP...` but Wireshark couldn't extract anything.

### Extract image files

We need to try another tool. `tcpxtract` to the rescue:

```bash

Looking at the .jpg images we see a small piece of the flag in each frame

![Security Footage Example Frame](Images/Security_Footage_Example_Frame.jpg)

### Get the flag

The flag was manually created by looking through the images:

`flag{5<REDACTED>}`
