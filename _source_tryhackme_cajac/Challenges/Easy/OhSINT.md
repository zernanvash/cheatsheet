### What city is this person in?

The first tweet contains a BSSID that we could locate

```text
From my house I can get free wifi ;D

Bssid: B4:5D:50:AA:86:41 - Go nuts!
```

with [Wigle.net](https://www.wigle.net/).

Login and select `Basic Search` in the View menu. Then search for the BSSID `B4:5D:50:AA:86:41`.

You may need to zoom out, recenter and zoom in to see more clearly since the map doesn't seem to center around the found area.
