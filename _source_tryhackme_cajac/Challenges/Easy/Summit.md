Description:
Can you chase a simulated adversary up the Pyramid of Pain until they finally back down?
```

## Solution

### Objective

After participating in one too many incident response activities, PicoSecure has decided to conduct a threat simulation and detection engineering engagement to bolster its malware detection capabilities. You have been assigned to work with an external penetration tester in an iterative purple-team scenario. The tester will be attempting to execute malware samples on a simulated internal user workstation. At the same time, you will need to configure PicoSecure's security tools to detect and prevent the malware from executing.

Following the **Pyramid of Pain**'s ascending priority of indicators, your objective is to increase the simulated adversaries' cost of operations and chase them away for good. Each level of the pyramid allows you to detect and prevent various indicators of attack.

#### Room Prerequisites

Completing the preceding rooms in the Cyber Defence Frameworks module will be beneficial before venturing into this challenge. Specifically, the following:

- The Pyramid of Pain
- MITRE

#### Connection Details

Please click **Start Machine** to deploy the application, and navigate to `https://10-10-207-156.p.thmlabs.com` once the URL has been populated.

Note: It may take a few minutes to deploy the machine entirely. If you receive a "Bad Gateway" response, wait a few minutes and refresh the page.

### What is the first flag you receive after successfully detecting sample1.exe?

We start by reading the first e-mail titled `Introduction: Penetration Test`

```text
Hey there.

I'm Sphinx, and I will be working with you on conducting threat simulation and detection engineering tests. I will attempt to execute malware samples on a simulated compromised user account to see if PicoSecure's security tools can detect the attacks.

This will be an iterative process; as your detection methods become more sophisticated, I will upgrade my malware samples to increase the difficulty of detection.

I will start with something simple, using "sample1.exe".

Scan this file using the Malware Sandbox tool and review the generated report. Maybe there's a unique way for you to distinguish this file and add a detection rule to block it. Once you manage to do so, I'll be in touch again.

Tip: You can access the various security tools by toggling the side menu (click the menu icon in the top left). You can revert your progress anytime with the "Revert Room" option in the side menu.

Next, we navigate to the `Malware Sandbox` tool, submit `sample1.exe` and get the following report:

### What is the second flag you receive after successfully detecting sample2.exe?

The next quest is in the same mail titled `Update: You Blocked Me!`:

```text
Hey again,

Good work. That detection you added blocked my malware from executing. Since file hashes and digests are unique to each file, they are, by far, the highest confidence indicators out there. You can be sure it's my malware sample the next time you see that hash.

However, by design, that is also one of the significant downfalls of simply relying on hashes for detection mechanisms. Since they are so susceptible to change, I only need to alter a single bit of the file, and the detection rule you added will fail.

In fact, all I did this time was recompile the malware, and I generated a new file hash and executed it without issue. See if you can come up with a new way to detect sample2.exe!

Here's your flag: THM{<REDACTED>}

-Sphinx
```

Next, we navigate to the `Malware Sandbox` tool again, submit `sample2.exe` and get the following report:

### What is the third flag you receive after successfully detecting sample3.exe?

The next mission is in the same mail titled `Stumped again... for now!`:

```text
Huh.

It seems like you stopped me again. You must have found the IP address to which my malware sample connected. Clever!

This method isn't bulletproof, though, as it's trivial for a motivated adversary to get around it using a new public IP address. I just signed up for a cloud service provider and now have access to many more public IPs!

This time, you'll need to detect sample3.exe another way. I already have my server running from a new IP address and have plenty more backups to failover in case they get blocked!

Good luck. 😈

Here's your flag: THM{<REDACTED>}

### What is the fourth flag you receive after successfully detecting sample4.exe?

The next task is in the same mail titled `RE: Stumped again... for now!`:

```text
Greetings again,

It looks like you were able to block my domain this time because every new IP address I try gets detected. You're causing me a bit of trouble now because I have to purchase and register some new domain names and modify DNS records. Some attackers might get mildly annoyed by this and find a new target, but I'm motivated to continue like many.

This time - blocking hashes, IPs, or domains won't help you. If you want to detect sample4.exe, consider what artifacts (or changes) my malware leaves on the victim's host system.

Good luck.

Here's your flag: THM{<REDACTED>}

Answer: `THM{<REDACTED>}`

### What is the fifth flag you receive after successfully detecting sample5.exe?

The next quest is in the same mail titled `New Approach`:

```text
Hey.

I'm not sure what you managed to do this time, but you seriously threw a wrench into my malware sample! I spent ages trying to reconfigure my attack tools and methodologies to get around your detection - SUPER ANNOYING!

Having my team develop new techniques used in my adversary tools was a time-consuming effort and a significant cost. It's good that we have a substantial budget for this engagement, but many threat actors would have given up and found a new victim by now.

I finally have sample5.exe for you to detect. Different approach this time. In this sample, all of the "heavy lifting" and instruction occurs on my back-end server, so I can easily change the types of protocols I use and the artifacts I leave on the host. You'll have to find something unique or abnormal about the behaviour of my tool to detect it.

I attached the logs of the outgoing network connections from the last 12 hours on the victim machine. That may help you correlate something.

I don't know what to do if you can stop me at this level.

Here's your flag: THM{<REDACTED>}

-Annoyed Sphinx

```text
Hello again,

You managed to detect sample5.exe ! I'm very impressed. But also very annoyed! Because now, I need to go back to the drawing board and create a brand new tool to do what I need to do. If I can't find another one quickly, this will be another significant investment. Also, I will need to train myself all over again on how to use it!

I can keep this up one or two times, but there's no way I can continue after this. The reward no longer outweighs the cost, and I would instead find an easier target with detection capabilities much lower on the pyramid.

For my last trick, I have sample6.exe. This time, you will need more than artifacts or tool detection to help you. You'll need to focus on something extremely hard for me to change subconsciously - my techniques and procedures.

I've attached the recorded command logs from all my previous samples to understand better what actions I tend to perform on my victims to extract info once I have remote access. Good luck!

Here's your flag: THM{<REDACTED>}
