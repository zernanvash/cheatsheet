## Solution

### Task 1 - Who's The Threat?

A multinational technology company has been the target of several cyber attacks in the past few months. The attackers have been successful in stealing sensitive intellectual property and causing disruptions to the company's operations. A threat advisory report about similar attacks has been shared, and as a CTI analyst, your task is to identify the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) being used by the Threat group and gather as much information as possible about their identity and motive. For this task, you will utilise the [OpenCTI](https://tryhackme.com/room/opencti) platform as well as the MITRE ATT&CK navigator, linked to the details below.

#### Assigned Tools

Start the virtual machine by clicking on the green "Start Machine" button on the upper right section of this task. Give it about 7 minutes to fully load and use the credentials below to access the platforms via the AttackBox or VPN to conduct your investigations.

- Username: `info@tryhack.io`
