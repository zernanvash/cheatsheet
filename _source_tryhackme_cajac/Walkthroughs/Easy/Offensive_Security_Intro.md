## Solution

### Beginning Your Learning Journey

#### Which of the following options better represents the process where you simulate a hacker's actions to find vulnerabilities in a system?

Hint: It involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access.

Answer: Offensive Security

### Hacking your first machine

Open a terminal window and run `gobuster` to enumerate directories

```bash
ubuntu@tryhackme:~/Desktop$ gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir

=====================================================
Gobuster v2.0.1              OJ Reeves (@TheColonial)

Ah, a `/bank-transfer` directory. Let's visit it in the browser.

Next, we input the wanted information:  
Send from: 2276  
Send to: 8881  
Amount to send in USD: 2000  
And press the `Send Money`-button

### Get the flag

Finally, click the `Return to Your Account`-button and note the flag (redacted here) in the textbox:

```text
