## Solution

### Task 1 - Introduction

*How do threat actors execute initial payloads? What typical commands are performed by threat actors once a persistent connection is established in the network? What does it look like in our environment?*

It can be overwhelming for security analysts to try learning every tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP) used by threat actors to test the capabilities of a Security Operations setup. That's why threat emulation frameworks were developed – they provide a structured and efficient way to simulate various techniques, making it easier for security analysts to evaluate the detection capabilities of a SOC. Many different approaches can be taken when emulating threats, and these frameworks help to organise and streamline the process.

#### Learning Objectives

In this room, we will learn how to utilise Atomic Red Team from the perspective of Blue Teamers, understanding how exactly threat actors run their TTPs and how significant it is to see it in action. In addition, we will tackle topics such as the following throughout the room:

- Break down of the Atomics - the main component of the Atomic Red Team Framework.
- Importance of emulated execution and cleanup during testing.
- Implications of threat emulation to detection engineering.

#### Room Prerequisites

It is suggested to clear the following rooms first before proceeding with this room:

- [Introduction to Threat Emulation](https://tryhackme.com/room/threatemulationintro)
- [Threat Modeling](https://tryhackme.com/room/threatmodelling)
- [Windows Event Logs](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowseventlogs)
- [Aurora](https://tryhackme.com/room/auroraedr)

Now, let's defeat threats by becoming one with them.

### Task 2 - Atomic Red Team

#### What is Atomic Red Team?

[Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) is an open-source project that provides a framework for performing security testing and threat emulation. It consists of tools and techniques that can be used to simulate various types of attacks and security threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, and network compromise. The Atomic Red Team aims to help security professionals assess the effectiveness of their organization's security controls and incident response processes and identify areas for improvement.

The Atomic Red Team framework is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing security professionals to select the tactics and techniques most relevant to their testing needs. It is intended to be used with other tools and frameworks, such as the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which provides a comprehensive overview of common tactics and techniques threat actors use.

All the credit goes to Red Canary for creating this fantastic framework.

**Supported Platforms**

Atomic Red Team supports emulation on a wide range of platforms, not only on known Operating Systems but also in Cloud Environments. Below is the list of platforms supported by the Atomic Red Team.

|Platform Type|Platforms Supported|
|----|----|
|Operating System|Windows, Linux, macOS|
|Cloud Infrastructure|AWS, Azure, GCP|
|Cloud Services|Office 365, Google Workspaces, Azure AD|
|Others|Containers (Kubernetes)|

Take note that these platforms pertain to the targets of threat emulation, where attack techniques are executed and observed.

**Understanding How Emulation Works**

In a nutshell, Atomic Red Team emulates commands that mimic threat activity using Executors. Below is the list of available executors.

|Executor|Operating System|Notes|
|----|----|----|
|sh or bash - `/bin/sh` or `/bin/bash`|Linux, macOS|Commands executed by this Executor are usually Unix tools used by threat actors for malicious intent.|
|Command Prompt - `cmd.exe`|Windows|Commands executed by this Executor are usually Windows Built-in or Third-party binaries used by threat actors for malicious intent.|
|PowerShell - `powershell.exe`|Windows|Emulated commands by this Executor are commonly known malicious PowerShell modules that threat actors abuse.|
|Manual|N/A|The details given in this type are typically written as steps needed to be executed to emulate a threat, such as when GUI steps are involved that cannot be automated.|

#### Deep-Dive Into Atomics

*Before seeing Executors in action, let's deal with the details inside an Atomic.*

Atomics refers to different testing techniques based on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. Each works as a standalone testing mock-up that Security Analysts can use to emulate a specific Technique, such as **OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory**, for a quick example.

Each Atomic typically contain two files, both of which are named by their MITRE ATT&CK Technique ID:

```bash
user@ATOMIC$ ls -lh T1003.001/
-rw-r--r--   1 user  user       300B Jan 4 22:57 T1003.001.md
-rw-r--r--   1 user  user       500B Jan 4 22:58 T1003.001.yaml
```

- **Markdown File (.md)** - Contains all the information about the technique, the supported platform, Executor, GUID, and commands to be executed.
- **YAML File (.yaml)** - Configuration used by frameworks, such as Invoke-Atomic and Atomic-Operator, to do the exact emulation of the technique

The Markdown file is written to be self-explanatory, so let's dive deep into the configuration files used to emulate commands.

*There are 12 atomic tests for T1003.001, but we will present only one test below for brevity.*

**Atomic YAML File Breakdown**

The first few fields are already given based on their field names:

- **attack_technique** - MITRE ATT&CK Technique ID, which also signifies the file's name.
- **display_name** - The technique name, similar to how it is presented as a MITRE Technique.
- **atomic_tests** - List of atomic tests, which details how every test is executed.

```bash
user@ATOMIC$ cat T1003.001/T1003.001.yaml

attack_technique: T1003.001
display_name: "OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory"
atomic_tests:
...
```

The following section details the contents of a single Atomic Test under the list of **atomic_tests** field:

- **name** - Short snippet that describes how it tests the technique.
- **auto_generated_guid** - Unique identifier of the specific test.
- **description** - A longer form of the test details and can be written in a multi-line format.
- **supported_platforms** - On what platform will the technique be executed (on a Windows machine in this case)
- **input_arguments** - Required values during the execution, resorts to the default value if nothing is supplied.

```yaml
...
- name: Dump LSASS.exe Memory using ProcDump
  auto_generated_guid: 0be2230c-9ab3-4ac2-8826-3199b9a0ebf8
  description: |
    The memory of lsass.exe is often dumped for offline credential theft attacks. This can be achieved with Sysinternals
    ProcDump.

    Upon successful execution, you should see the following file created c:\windows\temp\lsass_dump.dmp.

    If you see a message saying "procdump.exe is not recognized as an internal or external command", try using the  get-prereq_commands to download and install the ProcDump tool first.
  supported_platforms:
  - windows
  input_arguments:
    output_file:
      description: Path where resulting dump should be placed
      type: Path
      default: C:\Windows\Temp\lsass_dump.dmp
    procdump_exe:
      description: Path of Procdump executable
      type: Path
      default: PathToAtomicsFolder\T1003.001\bin\procdump.exe
```

To conclude with the contents of an Atomic test, details about **dependencies** and **executors** are as follows:

- **dependency_executor_name** - Option on how the prerequisites will be validated. The possible values for this field are similar to the Executor field.
- **dependencies**
  - **prereq_command** - Commands to check if the requirements for running this test are met. The conditions for the "command_prompt" Executor are not satisfied if any command returns a non-zero exit code. For the "Powershell" Executor, all commands are run as a script block, and the script block must return 0 for success.
  - **get_prereq_command** - Commands to meet this prerequisite or a message describing how to meet this requirement.
- **executor**
  - **name** - Name of the Executor; similar to what has been discussed above.
  - **command** - Exact command to emulate the technique.
  - **cleanup_command** - Commands for cleaning up the previous atomic test, such as deletion of files or reverting modified configurations.
  - **elevation_required** - A boolean value that dictates if an admin privilege is required.

```powershell
...
  dependency_executor_name: powershell
  dependencies:
  - description: |
      ProcDump tool from Sysinternals must exist on disk at specified location (#{procdump_exe})
    prereq_command: |
      if (Test-Path #{procdump_exe}) {exit 0} else {exit 1}
    get_prereq_command: |
      [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
      Invoke-WebRequest "https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Procdump.zip" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\Procdump.zip"
      Expand-Archive $env:TEMP\Procdump.zip $env:TEMP\Procdump -Force
      New-Item -ItemType Directory (Split-Path #{procdump_exe}) -Force | Out-Null
      Copy-Item $env:TEMP\Procdump\Procdump.exe #{procdump_exe} -Force
  executor:
    name: command_prompt
    command: |
      #{procdump_exe} -accepteula -ma lsass.exe #{output_file}
    cleanup_command: |
      del "#{output_file}" >nul 2> nul
    elevation_required: true
```

Before concluding this section, it is essential to highlight the **cleanup** feature of Atomics. But why is cleanup significant in threat emulation?

- First and foremost, it helps to ensure that the tested system returns to its original state after completing the emulation.
- Next, writing cleanup scripts help in minimizing the risk of accidental damage to the system since it serves as an additional verification of the execution. You understand the impact more as you write the reverse of the emulation.
- Lastly, it helps to maintain the integrity of the system being tested. Tools left after emulation exercises could be abused by potential threat actors.

### Task 3 - Invoke-AtomicRedTeam

We have previously understood Atomic Red Team and how Atomics work; let's extend our knowledge by seeing it in action.

As discussed, the main goal of the Atomic Red Team Framework is to ease the threat emulation process. Hence, tools such as **Invoke-AtomicTest** were created to utilise the automation and execution of Atomics. Let's start playing with these tools by emulating different attack patterns.

You may start the machine attached to this room by clicking the **Start Machine** button. This VM hosts the tools needed throughout the room.

Note: If the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top-right of the page. In addition, you may use the following credentials for alternative access via Remote Desktop (RDP):

- Username: `administrator`
- Password: `Emulation101!`
- IP Address: `10.65.130.0`

#### Invoke-AtomicRedTeam

[Invoke-AtomicRedTeam](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/wiki) is a PowerShell module created by the same author (Red Canary) that allows Security Analysts to run simulations defined by Atomics. To avoid confusion, the primary cmdlet used in this module is `Invoke-AtomicTest` and not `Invoke-AtomicRedTeam`.

**Setup**

Open a PowerShell window with ExecutionPolicy set to bypass inside the provided Virtual Machine. This ignores all security warning prompts while loading the module.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator>powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass
```

Then load the module using the **Import-Module** cmdlet specifying the location of the `Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1` file.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Import-Module "C:\Tools\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1" -Force

PS C:\Users\Administrator> $PSDefaultParameterValues = @{"Invoke-AtomicTest:PathToAtomicsFolder"="C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics"}
```

The additional command executed after the **Import-Module** specifies the location of the Atomics folder in this machine since it is not located in the default location, which is the `C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics` directory. You might encounter an error if the latter command is not executed.

You can confirm if the module is successfully loaded once the **help** cmdlet provides information about **Invoke-AtomicTest**.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> help Invoke-AtomicTest

NAME
    Invoke-AtomicTest

SYNTAX
    Invoke-AtomicTest [-AtomicTechnique]  [-ShowDetails] [-ShowDetailsBrief] [-TestNumbers ]
    [-TestNames ] [-TestGuids ] [-PathToAtomicsFolder ] [-CheckPrereqs]
    [-PromptForInputArgs] [-GetPrereqs] [-Cleanup] [-NoExecutionLog] [-ExecutionLogPath ] [-Force] [-InputArgs
    ] [-TimeoutSeconds ] [-Session ] [-Interactive] [-KeepStdOutStdErrFiles]
    [-LoggingModule ] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]  []


ALIASES
    None


REMARKS
    None
```

Based on the output of the help cmdlet, it can be seen that the syntax **Invoke-AtomicTest** goes in this format: `Invoke-AtomicTest <NAME> <Optional parameters>`

Note that the NAME placeholder uses the Technique ID of the target Atomic; the value "**ALL**" specifies that every Atomic will be used. The optional parameters will be highlighted in the succeeding sections.

**Listing Atomic Techniques**

Before going to the emulation proper, let's first discuss the importance of understanding the Atomics before running commands.

We have previously elaborated the contents of an Atomic file, which contains mostly how the emulation works from start to finish. However, navigating through the GIT repository and reading the information about the techniques you want to emulate may be gruesome. With that in mind, this module can use a parameter that provides the details inside an Atomic file - **ShowDetailsBrief** and **ShowDetails**.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1127 -ShowDetailsBrief
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

T1127-1 Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe
T1127-2 Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll
```

The output shows that **ShowDetailsBrief** lists the available tests in the specified Atomic and its corresponding Atomic Test number.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1127 -ShowDetails
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

[********BEGIN TEST*******]
Technique: Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution T1127
Atomic Test Name: Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe
Atomic Test Number: 1
Atomic Test GUID: 1ec1c269-d6bd-49e7-b71b-a461f7fa7bc8
Description: Use jsc.exe to compile javascript code stored in scriptfile.js and output scriptfile.exe. https://lolbas-pr
oject.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Jsc/ https://www.phpied.com/make-your-javascript-a-windows-exe/

Attack Commands:
Executor: command_prompt
ElevationRequired: False
Command:
copy #{filename} %TEMP%\hello.js
#{jscpath}\#{jscname} %TEMP%\hello.js
Command (with inputs):
copy C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\hello.js %TEMP%\hello.js
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\jsc.exe %TEMP%\hello.js

Cleanup Commands:
Command:
del %TEMP%\hello.js
del %TEMP%\hello.exe
---- Dependencies section is redacted, and will be discussed in the next section ---
```

The output above shows that the **ShowDetails** parameter is the verbose version of **ShowDetailsBrief**, which only provides the list of tests inside the Atomic T1127.  

It may not be direct, but these two parameters are significant in executing emulation exercises. It is essential to learn and understand how many tests will be conducted under an Atomic, how it will be performed, and how to clean it up. Knowing these items gives us an overview of the impact on the target environment.

**Preparing Atomic Prerequisites**

Remember that every Atomic test may require some dependencies, such as binaries and files needed for execution. Below is the excerpt of Atomic T1127-1's dependency section using the **ShowDetails** parameter.

```powershell
Dependencies:
Description: JavaScript code file must exist on disk at specified location (C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\hel
lo.js)
Check Prereq Command:
if (Test-Path #{filename}) {exit 0} else {exit 1}
Check Prereq Command (with inputs):
if (Test-Path C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\hello.js) {exit 0} else {exit 1}
Get Prereq Command:
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{filename}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1127/src/hello.js" -OutFile "#{fil
ename}"
Get Prereq Command (with inputs):
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\hello.js) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1127/src/hello.js" -OutFile "C:\To
ols\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\hello.js"
[!!!!!!!!END TEST!!!!!!!]
```

It is crucial to verify if the dependencies are met before executing the tests, and this can be done by using the **CheckPrereqs** parameter. In the case of  **Atomic T1127-1**, the file from `C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\hello.js` should exist.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1127 -CheckPrereqs
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

CheckPrereq's for: T1127-1 Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe
Prerequisites met: T1127-1 Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe
CheckPrereq's for: T1127-2 Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll
Prerequisites met: T1127-2 Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll
```

If the required binaries, files or scripts do not exist in the machine, the **GetPrereqs** parameter can be used. This parameter automatically pulls the dependencies from an external resource. It also details what conditions are being attempted to satisfy and confirms if the prerequisite is already met.

**Note**: Usage of the **GetPrereqs** feature may fail since the provided instance has **no outbound internet connection**.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1127 -GetPrereqs
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

GetPrereq's for: T1127-1 Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe
Attempting to satisfy prereq: JavaScript code file must exist on disk at specified location (C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\hello.js)
Prereq already met: JavaScript code file must exist on disk at specified location (C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\hello.js)
GetPrereq's for: T1127-2 Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll
Attempting to satisfy prereq: JavaScript code file must exist on disk at specified location (C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\LibHello.js)
Prereq already met: JavaScript code file must exist on disk at specified location (C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics\T1127\src\LibHello.js)
```

With everything prepared, the only thing left is to execute the Atomic tests.

**Execution**

Let's do the fun part, starting with emulating different MITRE ATT&CK Techniques. First, there are multiple ways to execute the Atomic tests, which will be detailed below.

|Parameter|Example|Details|
|----|----|----|
|TestNumbers|`Invoke-AtomicTest T1127 -TestNumbers 1,2`|Executes tests based on the Atomic test number|
|TestNames|`Invoke-AtomicTest T1127 -TestNames "Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll"`|Executes tests based on the Atomic test names|
|TestGuids|`Invoke-AtomicTest T1127 -TestGuids 3fc9fea2-871d-414d-8ef6-02e85e322b80`|Executes tests based on the test GUID|
|N/A|`Invoke-AtomicTest T1127`|Executes all tests under Atomic T1127|
|N/A|`Invoke-AtomicTest T1127-2`|Executes Atomic Test #2 of T1127|

As an example, let's now see the tests in action with Atomic T1053.005 - Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1053.005 -ShowDetailsBrief
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

T1053.005-1 Scheduled Task Startup Script
T1053.005-2 Scheduled task Local
T1053.005-3 Scheduled task Remote
T1053.005-4 Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task
T1053.005-5 Task Scheduler via VBA
T1053.005-6 WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task
T1053.005-7 Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry
T1053.005-8 Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute
T1053.005-9 PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task
# Output shows nine tests are available for T1053.005

PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1053.005 -TestNumbers 1,2
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

Executing test: T1053.005-1 Scheduled Task Startup Script
-- redacted --
Done executing test: T1053.005-1 Scheduled Task Startup Script
Executing test: T1053.005-2 Scheduled task Local
-- redacted --
Done executing test: T1053.005-2 Scheduled task Local
# Output shows ONLY TWO tests have been executed from T1053.005
```

You may have observed that the number of available tests was listed before conducting the test, and only two tests out of nine were executed due to the **TestNumbers** parameter.

**Cleanup**

As mentioned throughout the room, cleaning up the mess of emulating different techniques is VERY IMPORTANT. The **Invoke-AtomicRedTeam** module also has the option to execute the cleanup commands to revert every footprint left by the tests. This can be done by using the **Cleanup** parameter.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> schtasks /tn T1053_005_OnLogon

Folder: \
TaskName                                 Next Run Time          Status
======================================== ====================== ===============
T1053_005_OnLogon                        N/A                    Ready

PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1053.005 -TestNumbers 1,2 -Cleanup
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

Executing cleanup for test: T1053.005-1 Scheduled Task Startup Script
Done executing cleanup for test: T1053.005-1 Scheduled Task Startup Script
Executing cleanup for test: T1053.005-2 Scheduled task Local
Done executing cleanup for test: T1053.005-2 Scheduled task Local

PS C:\Users\Administrator> schtasks /tn T1053_005_OnLogon
ERROR: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

You may have observed that we executed **schtasks** before cleaning up the scheduled tasks created by the Atomic test **T1053.005**. This only shows that a scheduled task exists and was cleaned up after using the cleanup parameter.

### Task 4 - Revisiting MITRE ATT&CK

Based on the previous tasks, it was highlighted that the Atomic Red Team framework is heavily tied-up with MITRE ATT&CK. One clear connection is that every Atomic is written for a specific MITRE Technique, with the files of every Atomic named as its corresponding MITRE Technique ID.

In addition, an excerpt from [atomicredteam.io](https://atomicredteam.io/atomics/#collection) shows the available Tactics and Atomics under it, the Collection tactic in this case.

![Atomic Red Team Example 1](Images/Atomic_Red_Team_Example_1.png)

This correlation shows us that to maximise the Atomic Red Team framework's usage, we need to utilise our knowledge in MITRE ATT&CK Framework. Let's play again with the ATT&CK Navigator, one of the tools introduced in the [Threat Modeling room](https://tryhackme.com/room/threatmodelling).

#### ATT&CK Navigator

The ATT&CK Navigator is hosted in the same virtual machine deployed from the previous task.

You may access it via this link - `http://10.65.130.0/`.

**Incorporating ATT&CK Navigator into Atomic Red Team**

Choosing what Atomic to pick might be overwhelming; thus, we need to have a sense of direction when doing threat emulation. By utilising ATT&CK Navigator, we can dump the TTPs used by known APTs or cybercriminal groups and emulate their Atomics.

To start, create a new layer in the ATT&CK Navigator and choose **Enterprise**.

![ATTACK Navigator Example 1](Images/ATTACK_Navigator_Example_1.png)

Then use the search functionality and navigate to the threat groups section. Let's select admin@338 as our interest group by clicking the select button. This action sets the techniques attributed to the **admin@338** group.

![ATTACK Navigator Example 2](Images/ATTACK_Navigator_Example_2.png)

Next, close the search sidebar by re-clicking the search icon, click the score button in the upper-right corner and put one (1) as its score. This action highlights all selected techniques, which eases out the readability of the matrix.

![ATTACK Navigator Example 3](Images/ATTACK_Navigator_Example_3.png)

Lastly, let's sort out the techniques per column to place the scored technique in the topmost position. Click the filter button until it is set to **sorting by score descending**, and eventually click the **expand sub-techniques** button to display all highlighted techniques and sub-techniques.

![ATTACK Navigator Example 4](Images/ATTACK_Navigator_Example_4.png)

Our steps should reflect all techniques we want to emulate from our selected threat group.

**Emulation of Admin@338 Group**

The following action is to list all techniques highlighted from the ATT&CK Navigator. It is essential to take note of the Tactic, Technique and its corresponding Technique ID, as every Atomic is named with the Technique ID. You may hover the mouse icon in the techniques to see the technique ID. Below is the summarised results we got from ATT&CK Navigator.

|Tactic|Technique ID|Technique|
|----|----|----|
|Initial Access|T1566.001|Spearphishing Attachment|
|Execution|T1203|Exploitation for Client Execution|
|Execution|T1059.003|Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell|
|Discovery|T1083|File and Directory Discovery|
|Discovery|T1082|System Information Discovery|
|Discovery|T1016|System Network Configuration Discovery|
|Discovery|T1049|System Network Connections Discovery|
|Discovery|T1007|System Service Discovery|
|Discovery|T1087.001|Account Discovery: Local Account|

We have extracted nine (9) out of all the techniques in MITRE ATT&CK. The next thing we need to do is to determine if an Atomic exists for these techniques.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator>ls C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics | Where-Object Name -Match "T1566.001|T1203|T1059.003|T1083|T1082|T1016|T1049|T1007|T1087.001"

d-----         1/3/2023   5:21 PM                T1566.001
```

Eight out of nine techniques are available to be emulated. Before executing the tests, we must verify each technique and list all known tests for each Atomic.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> 'T1566.001','T1059.003','T1083','T1082','T1016','T1049','T1007','T1087.001' | ForEach-Object {echo "Enumerating $_"; Invoke-AtomicTest $_ -ShowDetailsBrief }

--- redacted for brevity ---
```

In addition, we need to check the prerequisites of each Atomic before starting the emulation.

```powershell

Given the number of tests for each Atomic, as shown above, we will only select one for brevity. Let's also focus on the tests that have met the prerequisites.

- **T1059.003-3** - Suspicious Execution via Windows Command Shell
- **T1083-1** - File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe)
- **T1082-6** - Hostname Discovery (Windows)
- **T1016-1** - System Network Configuration Discovery on Windows
- **T1049-1** - System Network Connections Discovery
- **T1007-2** - System Service Discovery - net.exe
- **T1087.001-9** - Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local)
- **T1566.001-1** - Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment

The only thing left now is to emulate the Atomics. Unlike the PowerShell command snippets above, we will only execute the tests one at a time. This is to observe the emulation and not be overwhelmed by the terminal output.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator>Invoke-AtomicTest T1059.003-3

### Task 5 - Emulation to Detection

From the previous tasks, we learned to operate with the Atomic Red Team framework and emulate different techniques across the mapping of MITRE ATT&CK. Now, let's wear our blue team hat and apply the benefits of threat emulation in detection engineering.

#### Observing Telemetry

The easiest way to understand different TTPs is to see them first-hand. We will learn and observe how techniques work by checking the events/logs generated by the Atomic tests. For this section, let's use the tests from Atomic **T1547.001**, which is all about [Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/).

```powershell

```

There are sixteen available tests for this Atomic, and all have prerequisites met. All of the tests can be executed without any problems.

**Sysmon**

For this task, we will view logs generated by Atomics through Sysmon. Let's fire up the Event Viewer and navigate to `Applications and Services` > `Microsoft` > `Windows` > `Sysmon` -> `Operational`. Once done, clear the existing records and start executing the first test.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTestT1547.001 -TestNumbers 1
PathToAtomicsFolder = C: \Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

Executing test: T1547.001-1 Reg Key Run
The operation completed successfully
Done executing test: T1547.001-1 Reg Key Run
```

Refresh the Event Viewer to view the latest updates, and always clear the logs before executing the next Atomic test.

![ART EventViewer 1](Images/ART_EventViewer_1.png)

**Note**: Log clearing will only be practical if the emulation is done in a test environment. You may not have the luxury of clearing the logs in a production setup. This may require an additional understanding of the Atomic breakdown before executing it to know what logs are expected to appear.

Upon completing Atomic Test **T1547.001-1**, it generated five records. We can ignore the first two logs as it is part of **Invoke-AtomicTest**'s execution; hence we can overlook the execution of the following binaries with PowerShell being its parent process throughout this task:

- whoami.exe
- hostname.exe

![ART EventViewer 2](Images/ART_EventViewer_2.png)

![ART EventViewer 3](Images/ART_EventViewer_3.png)

Ignoring the first two entries, we are left with three logs generated by the emulated Atomic test. The following three entries are Process Create events (Sysmon Event ID 1) and a single Registry Value Set event (Sysmon Event ID 13).

**Process Create Logs**

![ART EventViewer 4](Images/ART_EventViewer_4.png)

![ART EventViewer 5](Images/ART_EventViewer_5.png)

**Registry Value Set Log**

![ART EventViewer 6](Images/ART_EventViewer_6.png)

Based on the images above, we can summarise the events generated by Atomic test T1547.001-1 with the following information:

- The test generated three significant events: two Process Create events and one Registry Value Set event.
- The two Process Create events are caused by the execution of the **reg.exe** binary via the **cmd.exe /c** parameter.
- For this type of attack, the **reg.exe** binary is being utilised by threat actors to modify the registry key **\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run**.
- Lastly, the Registry Value points to a malicious binary (`C:\Path\AtomicRedTeam.exe`), which indicates that the binary will be executed during user logon.

We have successfully reflected the first Atomic Test via Sysmon logs. Let's continue emulating the subsequent tests with Aurora EDR to test its detection capabilities.

#### Aurora EDR

**Note**: If you are unfamiliar with Aurora EDR, you may proceed with [this room](https://tryhackme.com/room/auroraedr) first.

For a quick recap, Aurora is a Windows endpoint agent that uses Sigma rules and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to detect threat patterns on local event streams using Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). It is easy to correlate our previous learnings because Sigma rules are associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

To run Aurora, open a PowerShell window. Then navigate to **C:\Tools\Aurora** and execute **aurora-agent-64.exe**.

```bat
C:\Users\Administrator>cd C:\Tools\Aurora
C:\Tools\Aurora> .\aurora-agent-64.exe
```

Wait for the message that states **Aurora Agent started** before going back to the execution of Atomic Test **T1547.001-2**. Once the tool has successfully loaded, proceed to the next Atomic Test.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1547.001 -TestNumbers 2
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

Executing test: T1547.001-2 Reg Key RunOnce
The operation completed successfully.
Done executing test: T1547.001-2 Reg Key RunOnce
```

After execution, you may observe that the window running Aurora EDR has generated several detections related to **Registry Modification**.

**Note**: You may ignore the detection of whoami.exe, as shown in the first two detection logs.

![ART Aurora 1](Images/ART_Aurora_1.png)

![ART Aurora 2](Images/ART_Aurora_2.png)

The results summarise the following information:

- Sigma Rule Title, Description, and Notable False Positives
- Sigma match strings used
- Execution details such as Process Names, Command-line parameters and Hashes

The execution above is an excellent example of testing deployed rules by utilising the Atomic Red Team for threat emulation. Moving forward, you may use the methodology gained from this task to test and improve your existing detection rules.

Now, continue emulating the remaining tests to answer the questions below.

### Task 6 - Customising Atomic Red Team

In some cases, the Atomic Red Team cannot cater to the organisation's needs, such as emulating MITRE techniques that do not have a corresponding Atomic or tailoring a specific use case that only fits within a particular infrastructure or configuration setup. With that in mind, we need to be capable of creating custom Atomic tests and maximising tests via custom arguments.

#### Custom Input Arguments

Going back to the contents of the Atomic files, the **input_argument** field defines a hashtable wherein the key is the input name, and the value is another hashtable specifying the input arguments. Let's use the Create Account: Local Account technique as an example to expound this further.

```powershell
user@ATOMIC$ cat T1136.001/T1136.001.yaml
...
  input_arguments:
    username:
      description: Username of the user to create
      type: String
      default: T1136.001_CMD
    password:
      description: Password of the user to create
      type: String
      default: T1136.001_CMD!
...
```

Using T1136.001 as an example, you may observe that the snippet above showcases two input names with the following information:

|Input Name|Input Definition|
|----|----|
|username|This input argument is described as the "Username of the user to create"<br>The username input type is **String**<br>The value defaults to **T1136.001_CMD**|
|password|This input argument is described as the "Password of the user to create"<br>The username input type is **String**<br>The value defaults to **T1136.001_CMD!**|

Knowing these, executing this Atomic test will create a user named **T1136.001_CMD**, having **T1136.001_CMD!** as its password.

We can test this out and verify it manually by executing Atomic Test #3 of T1136.001.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001 -TestNumbers 3
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

Executing test: T1136.001-3 Create a new user in a command prompt
The password does not meet the password policy requirements. Check the minimum password length, password complexity and password history requirements.
More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2245.
Done executing test: T1136.001-3 Create a new user in a command prompt
```

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> net user

User accounts for \\ATOMIC

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            DefaultAccount           Guest
WDAGUtilityAccount
The command completed successfully.
```

Based on the output of the Atomic test and the `net user` command,  the user was not created successfully due to the existing password policy requirement. We can try customising the input arguments and replacing the password to satisfy the policy.

For this, we can either use one of these two parameters:

- **PromptForInputArgs** - set the values of the input arguments interactively

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001 -TestNumbers 3 -PromptForInputArgs
```

- **InputArgs** - pass a hashtable that contains the key-value pair of input arguments and its values

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> $customArgs = @{ "username" = "THM_Atomic"; "password" = "p@ssw0rd" }
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001 -TestNumbers 3 -InputArgs $customArgs
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

Executing test: T1136.001-3 Create a new user in a command prompt
The command completed successfully.
Done executing test: T1136.001-3 Create a new user in a command prompt
```

The execution of the following commands below resulted in a new user named **THM_Atomic**.

The result can then be verified by checking the local users via **net.exe**. The user **THM_Atomic** was successfully created, as shown in the output below.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> net user

User accounts for \\ATOMIC

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            DefaultAccount           Guest
THM_Atomic               WDAGUtilityAccount
The command completed successfully.
```

Lastly, these parameters can be used in conjunction with the **cleanup** parameter. Given the case, you need to specify the values used to revert successfully after the execution.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001 -TestNumbers 3 -PromptForInputArgs -Cleanup
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\Tools\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

Enter a value for password , or press enter to accept the default.
Password of the user to create [T1136.001_CMD!]:
Enter a value for username , or press enter to accept the default.
Username of the user to create [T1136.001_CMD]: THM_Atomic
Executing cleanup for test: T1136.001-3 Create a new user in a command prompt
Done executing cleanup for test: T1136.001-3 Create a new user in a command prompt
PS C:\Users\Administrator> net users

User accounts for \\ATOMIC

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            DefaultAccount           Guest
WDAGUtilityAccount
The command completed successfully.
```

The command snippet above shows that the newly created account was successfully removed from the users' list.

One last important thing to highlight is that not all Atomics can use this functionality. Only the Atomics that have defined the **input_arguments** section can change values during execution. If you need to execute a more specific test, you may create your Atomic test.

#### Creating New Atomic Tests

The **Invoke-AtomicRedTeam** module also has a functionality that eases up the creation of Atomic Tests, and it is named the Atomic GUI.

The Atomic GUI is a web-based form that users can fill out to generate the YAML definition of Atomic Tests. The result of this tool can then be inserted into the appropriate Atomic technique.

To start the web application, execute **Start-AtomicGUI** via PowerShell.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Start-AtomicGui
Stopped all AtomicGUI Dashboards

Name      Port Running DashboardService
----      ---- ------- ----------------
AtomicGUI 8487    True UniversalDashboard.Services.DashboardService
```

Once the tool runs, access the application using the URL `http://localhost:8487/home` via a browser.

![ART GUI 1](Images/ART_GUI_1.png)

You may observe that all the values needed for a test can be quickly filled out, like:

- Atomic Test Name and Definition
- Supported Platforms
- Attack Commands, Command Executor, Required Elevation and Cleanup Commands
- Custom input arguments
- Prerequisites and their Executor

![ART GUI 2](Images/ART_GUI_2.png)

After writing the values, you can generate the output by clicking **GENERATE TEST DEFINITION**. This results in a YAML output that can be inserted into any Atomic Techniques needing modification.

![ART GUI 3](Images/ART_GUI_3.png)

**Note**: Add two spaces to align the Atomic Tests in the target Atomic YAML file. You may click the highlighted button above twice to insert the appropriate indentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### What parameter should you use to customise the input arguments interactively?

Answer: `PromptForInputArgs`

#### What parameter should you use in conjunction with InputArgs/PromptForInputArgs to revert the changes made by the test?

Answer: `cleanup`

#### What is the default port used by the Atomic GUI?

Answer: `8487`

### Task 7 - Case Study: Emulating APT37

To apply all items discussed in the previous tasks, let's do a case study for the emulation of APT37.

APT37, also known as Reaper, is a cyber espionage group that has been active since 2012 and is believed to be operating out of North Korea. The group has been known to target a wide range of organisations, including government agencies, defence contractors, and media companies.

You may follow these guidelines, which is a summary of the methodology covered above:

- Start by gathering the techniques attributed to APT37 using ATT&CK Navigator.
- Correlate all existing Atomics with the known techniques the given threat actor uses.
- Emulate all available Atomic Tests and observe the events generated via Event Viewer or Aurora EDR.
- Ensure to execute a cleanup after every test.
- Document and review the results.

Lastly, answer the questions below to complete this task. Good luck!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Using the ATT&CK Navigator, how many techniques are attributed to APT37?

Hint: Some techniques are under multiple tactics. Get the unique number of techniques, including the sub-techniques.

![ATTACK Navigator APT37](Images/ATTACK_Navigator_APT37.png)

Answer: `29`

#### Using the mapping provided by the ATT&CK Navigator, what is the phishing technique used by the threat group?

See above.

Answer: `Spearphishing Attachment`

#### How many techniques attributed to APT37 have an existing Atomic file?

Hint: Your filters should only include exact Atomic to Technique ID matching. (e.g. Searching T0001 might also include T0001.001 in the results)

Answer: `21`

#### Based on the results of Q3, which Atomic has no tests supported on Windows?

Hint: As of writing, this technique only has Atomic tests available for Linux and none for Windows.

Answer: `T1059.006`

### Task 8 - Conclusion

Congratulations! You have completed the Atomic Red Team room.

Throughout the room, we have tackled the following topics about how Blue Teamers can leverage Atomic Red Team:

- Breakdown of each Atomic, the main component of the Atomic Red Team Framework.
- Tools such as **Invoke-AtomicRedTeam** and **ATT&CK Navigator** to model and execute threat activity.
- Importance of reverting or cleaning up after conducting the tests.
- Logging and Detection Rules review based on the emulation activity.
- Customisation of Atomic tests for the specific needs during testing.
- Case study simulation to emulate the activity of a known threat group.

Threat Emulation Frameworks such as the Atomic Red Team are commonly viewed as a tool only for Red Teamers, yet being knowledgeable about it may aid in learning how threat actors do the job. Knowing how attackers do it simplifies understanding how to defend it.
