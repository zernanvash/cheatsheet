## Solution

### Task 1 - Introduction

![Zeek_Logo](Images/Zeek_Logo.png)

Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source and commercial network monitoring tool (traffic analyser).

The [official description](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/about.html); "*Zeek (formerly Bro) is the world's leading platform for network security monitoring. Flexible, open-source, and powered by defenders." "Zeek is a passive, open-source network traffic analyser. Many operators use Zeek as a network security monitor (NSM) to support suspicious or malicious activity investigations. Zeek also supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks beyond the security domain, including performance measurement and troubleshooting.*"

The room aims to provide a general network monitoring overview and work with Zeek to investigate captured traffic. This room will expect you to have basic Linux familiarity and Network fundamentals (ports, protocols and traffic data). We suggest completing the "[Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals)" path before starting working in this room.

A VM is attached to this room. You don't need SSH or RDP; the room provides a "**Split View**" feature. Exercise files are located in the folder on the desktop. Log cleaner script "**clear-logs.sh**" is available in each exercise folder.

### Task 2 - Network Security Monitoring and Zeek

#### Introduction to Network Monitoring Approaches

Network monitoring is a set of management actions to watch/continuously overview and optionally save the network traffic for further investigation. This action aims to detect and reduce network problems, improve performance, and in some cases, increase overall productivity. It is a main part of the daily IT/SOC operations and differs from Network Security Monitoring (NSM) in its purpose.

**Network Monitoring**

Network monitoring is highly focused on IT assets like uptime (availability), device health and connection quality (performance), and network traffic balance and management (configuration). Monitoring and visualising the network traffic, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis are also part of the Network Monitoring process. This model is helpful for network administrators and usually doesn't cover identifying non-asset in-depth vulnerabilities and significant security concerns like internal threats and zero-day vulnerabilities. Usually, Network Monitoring is not within the SOC scope. It is linked to the enterprise IT/Network management team.

**Network Security Monitoring**

Network Security Monitoring is focused on network anomalies like rogue hosts, encrypted traffic, suspicious service and port usage, and malicious/suspicious traffic patterns in an intrusion/anomaly detection and response approach. Monitoring and visualising the network traffic and investigating suspicious events is a core part of Network Security Monitoring. This model is helpful for security analysts/incident responders, security engineers and threat hunters and covers identifying threats, vulnerabilities and security issues with a set of rules, signatures and patterns. Network Security Monitoring is part of the SOC, and the actions are separated between tier 1-2-3 analyst levels.

#### What is ZEEK?

Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source and commercial passive Network Monitoring tool (traffic analysis framework) developed by Lawrence Berkeley Labs. Today, Zeek is supported by several developers, and Corelight provides an Enterprise-ready fork of Zeek. Therefore this tool is called both open source and commercial. The differences between the open-source version and the commercial version are detailed here.

Zeek differs from known monitoring and IDS/IPS tools by providing a wide range of detailed logs ready to investigate both for forensics and data analysis actions. Currently, Zeek provides 50+ logs in 7 categories.

#### Zeek vs Snort

While both are called IDS/NIDS, it is good to know the cons and pros of each tool and use them in a specific manner. While there are some overlapping functionalities, they have different purposes for usage.

|Tool|Zeek|Snort|
|----|----|----|
|**Capabilities**|NSM and IDS framework. It is heavily focused on network analysis. It is more focused on specific threats to trigger alerts. The detection mechanism is focused on events.|An IDS/IPS system. It is heavily focused on signatures to detect vulnerabilities. The detection mechanism is focused on signature patterns and packets.|
|**Cons**|Hard to use.<br>The analysis is done out of the Zeek, manually or by automation.|Hard to detect complex threats.|
|**Pros**|It provides in-depth traffic visibility.<br>Useful for threat hunting.<br>Ability to detect complex threats.<br>It has a scripting language and supports event correlation.<br>Easy to read logs.|Easy to write rules.<br>Cisco supported rules.<br>Community support.|
|**Common Use Case**|Network monitoring.<br>In-depth traffic investigation.<br>Intrusion detecting in chained events.|Intrusion detection and prevention.<br>Stop known attacks/threats.|

#### Zeek Architecture

Zeek has two primary layers; "Event Engine" and "Policy Script Interpreter". The Event Engine layer is where the packets are processed; it is called the event core and is responsible for describing the event without focusing on event details. It is where the packages are divided into parts such as source and destination addresses, protocol identification, session analysis and file extraction. The Policy Script Interpreter layer is where the semantic analysis is conducted. It is responsible for describing the event correlations by using Zeek scripts.

![Zeek Architecture](Images/Zeek_Architecture.png)

#### Zeek Frameworks

Zeek has several frameworks to provide extended functionality in the scripting layer. These frameworks enhance Zeek's flexibility and compatibility with other network components. Each framework focuses on the specific use case and easily runs with Zeek installation. For instance, we will be using the "Logging Framework" for all cases. Having ide on each framework's functionality can help users quickly identify an event of interest.

Available Frameworks

- Broker Communication
- Cluster
- Configuration
- File Analysis
- GeoLocation
- Input
- Intelligence
- Logging
- NetControl
- Notice
- Packet Analysis
- Signature
- Summary
- Supervisor
- TLS Decryption

You can read more on frameworks [here](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/index.html).

#### Zeek Outputs

As mentioned before, Zeek provides 50+ log files under seven different categories, which are helpful in various areas such as traffic monitoring, intrusion detection, threat hunting and web analytics. This section is not intended to discuss the logs in-depth. The logs are covered in **TASK 3**.

Once you run Zeek, it will automatically start investigating the traffic or the given pcap file and generate logs automatically. Once you process a pcap with Zeek, it will create the logs in the working directory. If you run the Zeek as a service, your logs will be located in the default log path. The default log path is: `/opt/zeek/logs/`.

#### Working with Zeek

There are two operation options for Zeek. The first one is running it as a service, and the second option is running the Zeek against a pcap. Before starting working with Zeek, let's check the version of the Zeek instance with the following command: `zeek -v`

Now we are sure that we have Zeek installed. Let's start the Zeek as a service! To do this, we need to use the "ZeekControl" module, as shown below. The "ZeekControl" module requires superuser permissions to use. You can elevate the session privileges and switch to the superuser account to examine the generated log files with the following command: `sudo su`

Here we can manage the Zeek service and view the status of the service. Primary management of the Zeek service is done with three commands; "status", "start", and "stop".

```bash
root@ubuntu$ zeekctl
Welcome to ZeekControl 2.X.0
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     stopped
[ZeekControl] > start
starting zeek ...
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     running   2541   13 Mar 18:25:08
[ZeekControl] > stop
stopping zeek ...
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     stopped
```

You can also use the "ZeekControl" mode with the following commands as well;

- `zeekctl status`
- `zeekctl start`
- `zeekctl stop`

The only way to listen to the live network traffic is using Zeek as a service. Apart from using the Zeek as a network monitoring tool, we can also use it as a packet investigator. To do so, we need to process the pcap files with Zeek, as shown below. Once you process a pcap file, Zeek automatically creates log files according to the traffic.

In pcap processing mode, logs are saved in the working directory. You can view the generated logs using the `ls -l` command.  

```bash
root@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r sample.pcap 

root@ubuntu$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  11366 Mar 13 20:45 conn.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    763 Mar 13 20:45 dhcp.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   2918 Mar 13 20:45 dns.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    254 Mar 13 20:45 packet_filter.log 
```

Main Zeek command line parameters are explained below;

|Parameter|Description|
|----|----|
|`-r`|Reading option, read/process a pcap file.|
|`-C`|Ignoring checksum errors.|
|`-v`|Version information.|
|`zeekctl`|ZeekControl module.|

Investigating the generated logs will require command-line tools (cat, cut, grep sort, and uniq) and additional tools (zeek-cut). We will cover them in the following tasks.

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Task 3 - Zeek Logs

#### Zeek Logs

![Zeek Banner Zeek Logs](Images/Zeek_Banner_Zeek_Logs.png)

Zeek generates log files according to the traffic data. You will have logs for every connection in the wire, including the application level protocols and fields. Zeek is capable of identifying 50+ logs and categorising them into seven categories. Zeek logs are well structured and tab-separated ASCII files, so reading and processing them is easy but requires effort. You should be familiar with networking and protocols to correlate the logs in an investigation, know where to focus, and find a specific piece of evidence.

Each log output consists of multiple fields, and each field holds a different part of the traffic data. Correlation is done through a unique value called "UID". The "UID" represents the unique identifier assigned to each session.

Zeek logs in a nutshell;

|Category|Description|Log Files|
|----|----|----|
|**Network**|Network protocol logs.|conn.log, dce_rpc.log, dhcp.log, dnp3.log, dns.log, ftp.log, http.log, irc.log, kerberos.log, modbus.log, modbus_register_change.log, mysql.log, ntlm.log, ntp.log, radius.log, rdp.log, rfb.log, sip.log, smb_cmd.log, smb_files.log, smb_mapping.log, smtp.log, snmp.log, socks.log, ssh.log, ssl.log, syslog.log, tunnel.log.|
|**Files**|File analysis result logs.|files.log, ocsp.log, pe.log, x509.log.|
|**NetControl**|Network control and flow logs.|netcontrol.log, netcontrol_drop.log, netcontrol_shunt.log, netcontrol_catch_release.log, openflow.log.|
|**Detection**|Detection and possible indicator logs.|intel.log, notice.log, notice_alarm.log, signatures.log, traceroute.log.|
|**Network Observations**|Network flow logs.|known_certs.log, known_hosts.log, known_modbus.log, known_services.log, software.log.|
|**Miscellaneous**|Additional logs cover external alerts, inputs and failures.|barnyard2.log, dpd.log, unified2.log, unknown_protocols.log, weird.log, weird_stats.log.|
|**Zeek Diagnostic**|Zeek diagnostic logs cover system messages, actions and some statistics.|broker.log, capture_loss.log, cluster.log, config.log, loaded_scripts.log, packet_filter.log, print.log, prof.log, reporter.log, stats.log, stderr.log, stdout.log.|

Please refer to [Zeek's official documentation](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/script-reference/log-files.html) and [Corelight log cheat sheet](https://corelight.com/about-zeek/zeek-data) for more information. Although there are multiple log files, some log files are updated daily, and some are updated in each session. Some of the most commonly used logs are explained in the given table.

|Update Frequency|Log Name|Description|
|----|----|----|
|**Daily**|known_hosts.log|List of hosts that completed TCP handshakes.|
|**Daily**|known_services.log|List of services used by hosts.|
|**Daily**|known_certs.log|List of SSL certificates.|
|**Daily**|software.log|List of software used on the network.|
|**Per Session**|notice.log|Anomalies detected by Zeek.|
|**Per Session**|intel.log|Traffic contains malicious patterns/indicators.|
|**Per Session**|signatures.log|List of triggered signatures.|

This is too much protocol and log information! Yes, it is true; a difficulty of working with Zeek is having the required network knowledge and investigation mindset. Don't worry; you can have both of these and even more knowledge by working through TryHackMe paths. Just keep the streak!

Brief log usage primer table;

|Overall Info|Protocol Based|Detection|Observation|
|----|----|----|----|
|conn.log|http.log|notice.log|known_host.log|
|files.log|dns.log|signatures.log|known_services.log|
|intel.log|ftp.log|pe.log|software.log|
|loaded_scripts.log|ssh.log|traceroute.log|weird.log|

You can categorise the logs before starting an investigation. Thus, finding the evidence/anomaly you are looking for will be easier. The given table is a brief example of using multiple log files. You can create your working model or customise the given one. Make sure you read each log description and understand the purpose to know what to expect from the corresponding log file. Note that these are not the only ones to focus on. Investigated logs are highly associated with the investigation case type and hypothesis, so do not just rely only on the logs given in the example table!

The table shows us how to use multiple logs to identify anomalies and run an investigation by correlating across the available logs.

- **Overall Info**: The aim is to review the overall connections, shared files, loaded scripts and indicators at once. This is the first step of the investigation.
- **Protocol Based**: Once you review the overall traffic and find suspicious indicators or want to conduct a more in-depth investigation, you focus on a specific protocol.
- **Detection**: Use the prebuild or custom scripts and signature outcomes to support your findings by having additional indicators or linked actions.
- **Observation**: The summary of the hosts, services, software, and unexpected activity statistics will help you discover possible missing points and conclude the investigation.

Remember, we mention the pros and cons of the Zeek logs at the beginning of this task. Now let's demonstrate the log viewing and identify the differences between them.

**Recall 1**: Zeek logs are well structured and tab-separated ASCII files, so reading and processing them is easy but requires effort.

**Recall 2**: Investigating the generated logs will require command-line tools (cat, cut, grep sort, and uniq) and additional tools (zeek-cut).

Opening a Zeek log with a text editor and built-in commands;

![Zeek Logs Example Walkthrough](Images/Zeek_Logs_Example_Walkthrough.png)

The above image shows that reading the logs with tools is not enough to spot an anomaly quickly. Logs provide a vast amount of data to investigate and correlate. You will need to have technical knowledge and event correlation ability to carry out an investigation. It is possible to use external visualisation and correlation tools such as ELK and Splunk. We will focus on using and processing the logs with a hands-on approach in this room.

In addition to Linux command-line tools, one auxiliary program called `zeek-cut` reduces the effort of extracting specific columns from log files. Each log file provides "field names" in the beginning. This information will help you while using `zeek-cut`. Make sure that you use the "fields" and not the "types".

|Tool/Auxilary Name|Purpose|
|----|----|
|**Zeek-cut**|Cut specific columns from zeek logs.|

Let's see the `zeek-cut` in action. Let's extract the uid, protocol, source and destination hosts, and source and destination ports from the `conn.log`. We will first read the logs with the `cat` command and then extract the event of interest fields with `zeek-cut` auxiliary to compare the difference.

```bash
root@ubuntu$ cat conn.log 
...
#fields    ts    uid    id.orig_h    id.orig_p    id.resp_h    id.resp_p    proto    service    duration    orig_bytes    resp_bytes    conn_state    local_orig    local_resp    missed_bytes    history    orig_pkts    orig_ip_bytes    resp_pkts    resp_ip_bytes    tunnel_parents

root@ubuntu$ cat conn.log | zeek-cut uid proto id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p 
CTMFXm1AcIsSnq2Ric    udp    192.168.121.2    51153    192.168.120.22    53

```

As shown in the above output, the `zeek-cut` auxiliary provides massive help to extract specific fields with minimal effort. Now take time to read log formats, practice the log reading/extracting operations and answer the questions.

### Task 4 - CLI Kung-Fu Recall: Processing Zeek Logs

![Zeek Banner Cmd-line Kung-Fu](Images/Zeek_Banner_Cmd-line_Kung-Fu.png)

Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are handy and good for accomplishing tasks and processing information quickly. There are multiple advantages of GUIs, especially when processing the information visually. However, when processing massive amounts of data, GUIs are not stable and as effective as the CLI (Command Line Interface) tools.

The critical point is: What if there is no "function/button/feature" for what you want to find/view/extract?

Having the power to manipulate the data at the command line is a crucial skill for analysts. Not only in this room but each time you deal with packets, you will need to use command-line tools, Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF) and regular expressions to find/view/extract the data you are looking for. This task provides quick cheat-sheet like information to help you write CLI queries for your event of interest.

#### Basics

View the command history:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ history`

Execute the 10th command in history:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ !10`

Execute the previous command:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ !!`

#### Read File

Read sample.txt file:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat sample.txt`

Read the first 10 lines of the file:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ head sample.txt`

Read the last 10 lines of the file:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ tail sample.txt`

#### Find & Filter

Cut the 1st field:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | cut -f 1`

Cut the 1st column:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | cut -c1`  
**Note**: This will cut only the first character! For fields/columns, use `-f`.

Filter specific keywords:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | grep 'keywords'`

Sort outputs alphabetically:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | sort`

Sort outputs numerically:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | sort -n`

Eliminate duplicate lines:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | uniq`  
**Note**: This requires the file to be sorted. Only adjacent line are deduplicated.

Count line numbers:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | wc -l`

Show line numbers:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | nl`

#### Advanced

Print line 11:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | sed -n '11p'`

Print lines between 10-15:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | sed -n '10,15p'`

Print lines below 11:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | awk 'NR < 11 {print $0}'`  
**Note**: This will print lines **up till**, but not including, line 11.

Print line 11:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat test.txt | awk 'NR == 11 {print $0}'`

#### Special

Filter specific fields of Zeek logs:  
`ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat signatures.log | zeek-cut uid src_addr dst_addr`

#### Other Use Cases

Remove duplicate values:  
`sort | uniq`

Remove duplicates and count the number of occurrences for each value:  
`sort | uniq -c`

Sort values numerically and recursively:  
`sort -nr`

Reverse string characters:  
`rev`

Cut field 1:  
`cut -f 1`

Split the string on every dot and print keep the first two fields:  
`cut -d '.' -f 1-2`

Display lines that don't match the "test" string:  
`grep -v 'test'`

Display lines that don't match one or both "test1" and "test2" strings:  
`grep -v -e 'test1' -e 'test2'`

View file information:  
`file`

Search the "Testvalue1" string everywhere, organise column spaces and view the output with less:  
`grep -rin Testvalue1 * | column -t | less -S`

### Task 5 - Zeek Signatures

![Zeek Banner Zeek Signatures](Images/Zeek_Banner_Zeek_Signatures.png)

#### Zeek Signatures

Zeek supports signatures to have rules and event correlations to find noteworthy activities on the network. Zeek signatures use low-level pattern matching and cover conditions similar to Snort rules. Unlike Snort rules, Zeek rules are not the primary event detection point. Zeek has a scripting language and can chain multiple events to find an event of interest. We focus on the signatures in this task, and then we will focus on Zeek scripting in the following tasks.

Zeek signatures are composed of three logical paths; signature id, conditions and action. The signature breakdown is shown in the table below;

|Component|Description|
|----|----|
|**Signature id**|**Unique** signature name.|
|**Conditions**|**Header**: Filtering the packet headers for specific source and destination addresses, protocol and port numbers.<br>**Content**: Filtering the packet payload for specific value/pattern.|
|**Action**|**Default action**: Create the `signatures.log` file in case of a signature match.<br>**Additional action**: Trigger a Zeek script.|

Now let's dig more into the Zeek signatures. The below table provides the most common conditions and filters for the Zeek signatures.

|Condition Field|Available Filters|
|----|----|
|**Header**|**src-ip**: Source IP.<br>**dst-ip**: Destination IP.<br>**src-port**: Source port.<br>**dst-port**: Destination port.<br>**ip-proto**: Target protocol. Supported protocols; TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMP6, IP, IP6|
|**Content**|**payload**: Packet payload.<br>**http-request**: Decoded HTTP requests.<br>**http-request-header**: Client-side HTTP headers.<br>**http-request-body**: Client-side HTTP request bodys.<br>**http-reply-header**: Server-side HTTP headers.<br>**http-reply-body**: Server-side HTTP request bodys.<br>**ftp**: Command line input of FTP sessions.|
|**Context**|**same-ip**: Filtering the source and destination addresses for duplication.|
|**Action**|**event**: Signature match message.|

Comparison Operators

- `==`
- `!=`
- `<`
- `<=`
- `>`
- `>=`

**NOTE**: Filters accept string, numeric and regex values.

Run Zeek with signature file

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r sample.pcap -s sample.sig
```

Zeek signatures use the ".sig" extension.

- `-C`: Ignore checksum errors.
- `-r`: Read pcap file.
- `-s`: Use signature file.

#### Example | Cleartext Submission of Password

Let's create a simple signature to detect HTTP cleartext passwords.

```text
signature http-password {
     ip-proto == tcp
     dst-port == 80
     payload /.*password.*/
     event "Cleartext Password Found!"
}

# signature: Signature name.
# ip-proto: Filtering TCP connection.
# dst-port: Filtering destination port 80.
# payload: Filtering the "password" phrase.
# event: Signature match message.
```

Remember, Zeek signatures support regex. Regex ".*" matches any character zero or more times. The rule will match when a "password" phrase is detected in the packet payload. Once the match occurs, Zeek will generate an alert and create additional log files (`signatures.log` and `notice.log`).

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r http.pcap -s http-password.sig 
ubuntu@ubuntu$ ls
clear-logs.sh  conn.log  files.log  http-password.sig  http.log  http.pcap  notice.log  packet_filter.log  signatures.log

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat notice.log  | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h msg 
10.10.57.178    44.228.249.3    10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!
10.10.57.178    44.228.249.3    10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat signatures.log | zeek-cut src_addr dest_addr sig_id event_msg 
10.10.57.178        http-password    10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!
10.10.57.178        http-password    10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!
```

As shown in the above terminal output, the `signatures.log` and `notice.log` provide basic details and the signature message. Both of the logs also have the application banner field. So it is possible to know where the signature match occurs. Let's look at the application banner!

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat signatures.log | zeek-cut sub_msg
POST /userinfo.php HTTP/1.1\x0d\x0aHost: testphp.vulnweb.com\x0d\x0aUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:98.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/...

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat notice.log  | zeek-cut sub
POST /userinfo.php HTTP/1.1\x0d\x0aHost: testphp.vulnweb.com\x0d\x0aUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:98.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/...
```

We will demonstrate only one log file output to avoid duplication after this point. You can practice discovering the event of interest by analysing `notice.log` and `signatures.log`.

#### Example | FTP Brute-force

Let's create another rule to filter FTP traffic. This time, we will use the FTP content filter to investigate command-line inputs of the FTP traffic. The aim is to detect FTP "admin" login attempts. This basic signature will help us identify the admin login attempts and have an idea of possible admin account abuse or compromise events.

```text
signature ftp-admin {
     ip-proto == tcp
     ftp /.*USER.*dmin.*/
     event "FTP Admin Login Attempt!"
}
```

Let's run the Zeek with the signature and investigate the `signatures.log` and `notice.log`.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-admin.sig
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat signatures.log | zeek-cut src_addr dst_addr event_msg sub_msg | sort -r| uniq
10.234.125.254    10.121.70.151    10.234.125.254: FTP Admin Login Attempt!    USER administrator
10.234.125.254    10.121.70.151    10.234.125.254: FTP Admin Login Attempt!    USER admin 
```

Our rule shows us that there are multiple logging attempts with account names containing the "admin" phrase. The output gives us great information to notice if there is a brute-force attempt for an admin account.

This signature can be considered a case signature. While it is accurate and works fine, we need global signatures to detect the "known threats/anomalies". We will need those case-based signatures for significant and sophistical anomalies like zero-days and insider attacks in the real-life environment. Having individual rules for each case will create dozens of logs and alerts and cause missing the real anomaly. The critical point is logging logically, not logging everything.

We can improve our signature by not limiting the focus only to an admin account. In that case, we need to know how the FTP protocol works and the default response codes. If you don't know these details, please refer to [RFC documentation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc765).

**Let's optimise our rule and make it detect all possible FTP brute-force attempts.**

This signature will create logs for each event containing "FTP 530 response", which allows us to track the login failure events regardless of username.

```text
signature ftp-brute {
     ip-proto == tcp
     payload /.*530.*Login.*incorrect.*/
     event "FTP Brute-force Attempt"
}
```

Zeek signature files can consist of multiple signatures. Therefore we can have one file for each protocol/situation/threat type. Let's demonstrate this feature in our global rule.

```text
signature ftp-username {
    ip-proto == tcp
    ftp /.*USER.*/
    event "FTP Username Input Found!"
}

signature ftp-brute {
    ip-proto == tcp
     payload /.*530.*Login.*incorrect.*/
    event "FTP Brute-force Attempt!"
}
```

Let's merge both of the signatures in a single file. We will have two different signatures, and they will generate alerts according to match status. The result will show us how we benefit from this action. Again, we will need the "CLI Kung-Fu" skills to extract the event of interest.

This rule should show us two types of alerts and help us to correlate the events by having "FTP Username Input" and "FTP Brute-force Attempt" event messages. Let's investigate the logs. We're grepping the logs in range 1001-1004 to demonstrate that the first rule matches two different accounts (admin and administrator).

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-admin.sig
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat notice.log | zeek-cut uid id.orig_h id.resp_h msg sub | sort -r| nl | uniq | sed -n '1001,1004p'
  1001    CeMYiaHA6AkfhSnd    10.234.125.254    10.121.70.151    10.234.125.254: FTP Username Input Found!    USER admin
  1002    CeMYiaHA6AkfhSnd    10.234.125.254    10.121.70.151    10.121.70.151: FTP Brute-force Attempt!    530 Login incorrect.
  1003    CeDTDZ2erDNF5w7dyf    10.234.125.254    10.121.70.151    10.234.125.254: FTP Username Input Found!    USER administrator
  1004    CeDTDZ2erDNF5w7dyf    10.234.125.254    10.121.70.151    10.121.70.151: FTP Brute-force Attempt!    530 Login incorrect.
```

#### Snort Rules in Zeek?

While Zeek was known as Bro, it supported Snort rules with a script called snort2bro, which converted Snort rules to Bro signatures. However, after the rebranding, workflows between the two platforms have changed. [The official Zeek document](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/signatures.html) mentions that the script is no longer supported and is not a part of the Zeek distribution.

### Task 6 - Zeek Scripts | Fundamentals

![Zeek Banner Zeek Scripts](Images/Zeek_Banner_Zeek_Scripts.png)

#### Zeek Scripts

Zeek has its own event-driven scripting language, which is as powerful as high-level languages and allows us to investigate and correlate the detected events. Since it is as capable as high-level programming languages, you will need to spend time on Zeek scripting language in order to become proficient. In this room, we will cover the basics of Zeek scripting to help you understand, modify and create basic scripts. Note that scripts can be used to apply a policy and in this case, they are called policy scripts.

Zeek has base scripts installed by default, and these are not intended to be modified.  
These scripts are located in `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base`.

User-generated or modified scripts should be located in a specific path.  
These scripts are located in `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/site`.

Policy scripts are located in a specific path.  
These scripts are located in `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy`.

Like Snort, to automatically load/use a script in live sniffing mode, you must identify the script in the Zeek configuration file. You can also use a script for a single run, just like the signatures.  
The configuration file is located in `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/local.zeek`.

- Zeek scripts use the `.zeek` extension.
- Do not modify anything under the "zeek/base" directory. User-generated and modified scripts should be in the "zeek/site" directory.
- You can call scripts in live monitoring mode by loading them with the command `load @/script/path` or `load @script-name` in local.zeek file.
- Zeek is event-oriented, not packet-oriented! We need to use/write scripts to handle the event of interest.

#### GUI vs Scripts

Have you ever thought about automating tasks in Wireshark, tshark or tcpdump? Zeek provides that chance to us with its scripting power. Let's say we need to extract all available DHCP hostnames from a pcap file. In that case, we have several options like using tcpdump, Wireshark, tshark or Zeek.

Let's see Wireshark on the stage first. You can have the same information with Wireshark. However, while this information can be extracted using Wireshark is not easy to transfer the data to another tool for processing. **Tcpdump** and **tshark** are command-line tools, and it is easy to extract and transfer the data to another tool for processing and correlating.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ sudo tcpdump -ntr smallFlows.pcap port 67 or port 68 -e -vv | grep 'Hostname Option' | awk -F: '{print $2}' | sort -nr | uniq | nl
     1     "vinlap01"
     2     "student01-PC"
ubuntu@ubuntu$ tshark -V -r smallFlows.pcap -Y "udp.port==67 or udp.port==68" -T fields -e dhcp.option.hostname | nl | awk NF
     1    student01-PC
     2    vinlap01
```

Now let's see Zeek scripts in action. First, let's look at the components of the Zeek script. Here the first, second and fourth lines are the predefined syntaxes of the scripting language. The only part we created is the third line which tells Zeek to extract DHCP hostnames. Now compare this automation ease with the rest of the methods. Obviously, this four-line script is easier to create and use. While tcpdump and tshark can provide similar results, transferring uncontrolled data through multiple pipelines is not much preferred.

```text
event dhcp_message (c: connection, is_orig: bool, msg: DHCP::Msg, options: DHCP::Options)
{
print options$host_name;
}
```

Now let's use the Zeek script and see the output.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r smallFlows.pcap dhcp-hostname.zeek 
student01-PC
vinlap01
```

The provided outputs show that our script works fine and can extract the requested information. This should show why Zeek is helpful in data extraction and correlation. Note that Zeek scripting is a programming language itself, and we are not covering the fundamentals of Zeek scripting. In this room, we will cover the logic of Zeek scripting and how to use Zeek scripts. You can learn and practice the Zeek scripting language by using [Zeek's official training platform](https://try.bro.org/#/?example=hello) for free.

There are multiple options to trigger conditions in Zeek. Zeek can use "Built-In Function" (Bif) and protocols to extract information from traffic data. You can find supported protocols and Bif either by looking in your setup or visiting the [Zeek repo](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/script-reference/scripts.html).

Customized script locations

- `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/bif`
- `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/bif/plugins`
- `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/protocols`

### Task 7 - Zeek Scripts | Scripts and Signatures

#### Scripts 101 | Write Basic Scripts

Scripts contain operators, types, attributes, declarations and statements, and directives. Let's look at a simple example event called "**zeek_init**" and "**zeek_done**". These events work once the Zeek process starts and stops. Note that these events don't have parameters, and some events will require parameters.

```text
event zeek_init()
    {
     print ("Started Zeek!");
    }
event zeek_done()
    {
    print ("Stopped Zeek!");
    }

# zeek_init: Do actions once Zeek starts its process.
# zeek_done: Do activities once Zeek finishes its process.
# print: Prompt a message on the terminal.
```

Run Zeek with the script

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r sample.pcap 101.zeek 
Started Zeek!
Stopped Zeek!
```

The above output shows how the script works and provides messages on the terminal. Zeek will create logs in the working directory separately from the scripts tasks.

Let's print the packet data to the terminal and see the raw data. In this script, we are requesting details of a connection and extracting them without any filtering or sorting of the data. To accomplish this, we are using the "**new_connection**" event. This event is automatically generated for each new connection. This script provides bulk information on the terminal. We need to get familiar with Zeek's data structure to reduce the amount of information and focus on the event of interest. To do so, we need to investigate the bulk data.

```text
event new_connection(c: connection)
{
    print c;
}
```

Run Zeek with the script

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r sample.pcap 102.zeek 
[id=[orig_h=192.168.121.40, orig_p=123/udp, resp_h=212.227.54.68, resp_p=123/udp], orig=[size=48, state=1, num_pkts=0, num_bytes_ip=0, flow_label=0, l2_addr=00:16:47:df:e7:c1], resp=[size=0, state=0, num_pkts=0, num_bytes_ip=0, flow_label=0, l2_addr=00:00:0c:9f:f0:79], start_time=1488571365.706238, duration=0 secs, service={}, history=D, uid=CajwDY2vSUtLkztAc, tunnel=, vlan=121, inner_vlan=, dpd=, dpd_state=, removal_hooks=, conn=, extract_orig=F, extract_resp=F, thresholds=, dce_rpc=, dce_rpc_state=, dce_rpc_backing=, dhcp=, dnp3=, dns=, dns_state=, ftp=, ftp_data_reuse=F, ssl=, http=, http_state=, irc=, krb=, modbus=, mysql=, ntlm=, ntp=, radius=, rdp=, rfb=, sip=, sip_state=, snmp=, smb_state=, smtp=, smtp_state=, socks=, ssh=, syslog=]
```

The above terminal provides bulk data for each connection. This style is not the best usage, and in real life, we will need to filter the information for specific purposes. If you look closely at the output, you can see an ID and field value for each part.

To filter the event of interest, we will use the primary tag (in this case, it is `c` --comes from "c: connection"--), id value (id=), and field name. You should notice that the fields are the same as the fields in the log files.

```text
event new_connection(c: connection)
{
    print ("###########################################################");
    print ("");
    print ("New Connection Found!");
    print ("");
    print fmt ("Source Host: %s # %s --->", c$id$orig_h, c$id$orig_p);
    print fmt ("Destination Host: resp: %s # %s <---", c$id$resp_h, c$id$resp_p);
    print ("");
}

# %s: Identifies string output for the source.
# c$id: Source reference field for the identifier.
```

Now you have a general idea of running a script and following the provided output on the console. Let's look closer to another script that extracts specific information from packets. The script above creates logs and prompts each source and destination address for each connection.

Let's see this script in action.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r sample.pcap 103.zeek 
###########################################################
New Connection Found! Source Host: 192.168.121.2 # 58304/udp ---> 
Destination Host: resp: 192.168.120.22 # 53/udp <--- 
###########################################################
```

The above output shows that we successfully extract specific information from the events. Remember that this script extracts the event of interest (in this example, a new connection), and we still have logs in the working directory. We can always modify and optimise the scripts at any time.

#### Scripts 201 | Use Scripts and Signatures Together

Up to here, we covered the basics of Zeek scripts. Now it is time to use scripts collaboratively with other scripts and signatures to get one step closer to event correlation. Zeek scripts can refer to signatures and other Zeek scripts as well. This flexibility provides a massive advantage in event correlation.

Let's demonstrate this concept with an example. We will create a script that detects if our previously created "**ftp-admin**" rule has a hit.

```text
event signature_match (state: signature_state, msg: string, data: string)
{
if (state$sig_id == "ftp-admin")
    {
    print ("Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin ");
    }
}
```

This basic script quickly checks if there is a signature hit and provides terminal output to notify us. We are using the "signature_match" event to accomplish this. You can read more about events here. Note that we are looking only for "**ftp-admin**" signature hits. The signature is shown below.

```text
signature ftp-admin {
    ip-proto == tcp
    ftp /.*USER.*admin.*/
    event "FTP Username Input Found!"
}
```

Let's see this script in action.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-admin.sig 201.zeek 
Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin
Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin
```

The above output shows that we successfully combined the signature and script. Zeek processed the signature and logs then the script controlled the outputs and provided a terminal output for each rule hit.

#### Scripts 202 | Load Local Scripts

Load all local scripts

We mentioned that Zeek has base scripts located in `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base`. You can load all local scripts identified in your `local.zeek` file. Note that base scripts cover multiple framework functionalities. You can load all base scripts by easily running the `local` command.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r ftp.pcap local 
ubuntu@ubuntu$ ls
101.zeek  103.zeek          clear-logs.sh  ftp.pcap            packet_filter.log  stats.log
102.zeek  capture_loss.log  conn.log       loaded_scripts.log  sample.pcap        weird.log 
```

The above output demonstrates how to run all base scripts using the `local` command. Look at the above terminal output; Zeek provided additional log files this time. Loaded scripts generated `loaded_scripts.log`, `capture_loss.log`, `notice.log`, `stats.log` files. Note that, in our instance, 465 scripts loaded and used by using the `local` command. However, Zeek doesn't provide log files for the scripts doesn't have hits or results.

Load Specific Scripts

Another way to load scripts is by identifying the script path. In that case, you have the opportunity of loading a specific script or framework. Let's go back to FTP brute-forcing case. We created a script that detects multiple admin login failures in previous steps. Zeek has an FTP brute-force detection script as well. Now let's use the default script and identify the differences.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r ftp.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/protocols/ftp/detect-bruteforcing.zeek 

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat notice.log | zeek-cut ts note msg 
1024380732.223481    FTP::Bruteforcing    10.234.125.254 had 20 failed logins on 1 FTP server in 0m1s
```

The above output shows how to load a specific script. This script provides much more information than the one we created. It provides one single line output and a connection summary for the suspicious incident. You can find and read more on the prebuilt scripts and frameworks by visiting Zeek's online book [here](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/index.html).

Answer: `498`

Go to folder **TASK-7/202**.

Investigate the `ftp-brute.pcap` file with `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/protocols/ftp/detect-bruteforcing.zeek` script. Investigate the `notice.log` file.

#### What is the total number of brute-force detections?

Answer: `2`

### Task 8 - Zeek Scripts | Frameworks

#### Scripts 203 | Load Frameworks

Zeek has 15+ frameworks that help analysts to discover the different events of interest. In this task, we will cover the common frameworks and functions. You can find and read more on the prebuilt scripts and frameworks by visiting Zeek's online book [here](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/index.html).

File Framework | Hashes

Not all framework functionalities are intended to be used in CLI mode. The majority of them are used in scripting. You can easily see the usage of frameworks in scripts by calling a specific framework as `load @ $PATH/base/frameworks/framework-name`. Now, let's use a prebuilt function of the file framework and have MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashes of the detected files. We will call the "**File Analysis**" framework's "**hash-all-files**" script to accomplish this. Before loading the scripts, let's look at how it works.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat hash-demo.zeek 
# Enable MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashing for all files.
@load /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/hash-all-files.zeek
```

The above output shows how frameworks are loaded. In earlier tasks, we mentioned that Zeek highly relies on scripts, and the frameworks depend on scripts. Let's have a closer look at the file hash framework and see the script behind it.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/hash-all-files.zeek 
# Enable MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashing for all files.

@load base/files/hash
event file_new(f: fa_file)
    {
    Files::add_analyzer(f, Files::ANALYZER_MD5);
    Files::add_analyzer(f, Files::ANALYZER_SHA1);
    Files::add_analyzer(f, Files::ANALYZER_SHA256);
    }
```

Now let's execute the script and investigate the log file.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r case1.pcap hash-demo.zeek
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r case1.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/hash-all-files.zeek 

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat files.log | zeek-cut md5 sha1 sha256
cd5a4d3fdd5bffc16bf959ef75cf37bc    33bf88d5b82df3723d5863c7d23445e345828904    6137f8db2192e638e13610f75e73b9247c05f4706f0afd1fdb132d86de6b4012
b5243ec1df7d1d5304189e7db2744128    a66bd2557016377dfb95a87c21180e52b23d2e4e    f808229aa516ba134889f81cd699b8d246d46d796b55e13bee87435889a054fb
cc28e40b46237ab6d5282199ef78c464    0d5c820002cf93384016bd4a2628dcc5101211f4    749e161661290e8a2d190b1a66469744127bc25bf46e5d0c6f2e835f4b92db18
```

Look at the above terminal outputs. Both of the scripts provided the same result. Here the preference is up to the user. Both of the usage formats are true. Prebuilt frameworks are commonly used in scriptings with the "@load" method. Specific scripts are used as practical scripts for particular use cases.

File Framework | Extract Files

The file framework can extract the files transferred. Let's see this feature in action!

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r case1.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/extract-all-files.zeek

ubuntu@ubuntu$ ls
101.zeek  102.zeek  103.zeek  case1.pcap  clear-logs.sh  conn.log  dhcp.log  dns.log  extract_files  files.log  ftp.pcap  http.log  packet_filter.log  pe.log
```

We successfully extracted files from the pcap. A new folder called `extract_files` is automatically created, and all detected files are located in it. First, we will list the contents of the folder, and then we will use the `file` command to determine the file type of the extracted files.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ ls extract_files | nl
     1    extract-1561667874.743959-HTTP-Fpgan59p6uvNzLFja
     2    extract-1561667889.703239-HTTP-FB5o2Hcauv7vpQ8y3
     3    extract-1561667899.060086-HTTP-FOghls3WpIjKpvXaEl

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cd extract_files

ubuntu@ubuntu$ file *| nl
     1    extract-1561667874.743959-HTTP-Fpgan59p6uvNzLFja:  ASCII text, with no line terminators

     3    extract-1561667899.060086-HTTP-FOghls3WpIjKpvXaEl: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
```

Zeek extracted three files. The `file` command shows us one .txt file, one .doc/.docx file and one .exe file. Zeek renames extracted files. The name format consists of four values that come from conn.log and files.log files; default "extract" keyword, timestamp value (ts), protocol (source), and connection id (conn_uids). Let's look at the files.log to understand possible anomalies better and verify the findings. Look at the below output; files.log provides the same results with additional details. Let's focus on the .exe and correlate this finding by searching its connection id (conn_uids).

The given terminal output shows us that there are three files extracted from the traffic capture. Let's look at the file.log and correlate the findings with the rest of the log files.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat files.log | zeek-cut fuid conn_uids tx_hosts rx_hosts mime_type extracted | nl
     1    Fpgan59p6uvNzLFja    CaeNgL1QzYGxxZPwpk    23.63.254.163    10.6.27.102    text/plain    extract-1561667874.743959-HTTP-Fpgan59p6uvNzLFja
     2    FB5o2Hcauv7vpQ8y3    CCwdoX1SU0fF3BGBCe    107.180.50.162    10.6.27.102    application/msword    extract-1561667889.703239-HTTP-FB5o2Hcauv7vpQ8y3

ubuntu@ubuntu$ grep -rin CZruIO2cqspVhLuAO9 * | column -t | nl | less -S
#NOTE: The full output is not shown here!. Redo the same actions in the attached VM!
     1    conn.log:43:1561667898.852600   CZruIO2cqspVhLuAO9  10.6.27.102     49162        107.180.50.162      80    tcp  http        
     2    files.log:11:1561667899.060086  FOghls3WpIjKpvXaEl  107.180.50.162  10.6.27.102  CZruIO2cqspVhLuAO9  HTTP  0    EXTRACT,PE  
     3    http.log:11:1561667898.911759   CZruIO2cqspVhLuAO9  10.6.27.102     49162        107.180.50.162      80    1    GET         
```

The `grep` tool helps us investigate the particular value across all available logs. The above terminal output shows us that the connection id linked with .exe appears in conn.log, files.log, and http.log files. Given example demonstrates how to filter some fields and correlate the findings with the rest of the logs. We've listed the source and destination addresses, file and connection id numbers, MIME types, and file names. Up to now, provided outputs and findings show us that record number three is a .exe file, and other log files provide additional information.

Notice Framework | Intelligence

The intelligence framework can work with data feeds to process and correlate events and identify anomalies. The intelligence framework requires a feed to match and create alerts from the network traffic. Let's demonstrate a single user-generated threat intel file and let Zeek use it as the primary intelligence source.

Intelligence source location: `/opt/zeek/intel/zeek_intel.txt`

There are two critical points you should never forget. First, the source file **has to be tab-delimited**. Second, you can manually update the source and adding extra lines doesn't require any re-deployment. However, if you delete a line from the file, you will need to re-deploy the Zeek instance.

Let's add the suspicious URL gathered from the `case1.pcap` file as a source intel and see this feature in action! Before executing the script, let's look at the intelligence file and the script contents.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat /opt/zeek/intel/zeek_intel.txt 
#fields    indicator    indicator_type    meta.source    meta.desc
smart-fax.com    Intel::DOMAIN    zeek-intel-test    Zeek-Intelligence-Framework-Test

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat intelligence-demo.zeek 
# Load intelligence framework!
@load policy/frameworks/intel/seen
@load policy/frameworks/intel/do_notice
redef Intel::read_files += { "/opt/zeek/intel/zeek_intel.txt" }; 
```

The above output shows the contents of the intel file and script contents. There is one intelligence input, and it is focused on a domain name, so when this domain name appears in the network traffic, Zeek will create the `intel.log` file and provide the available details.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r case1.pcap intelligence-demo.zeek 

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat intel.log | zeek-cut uid id.orig_h id.resp_h seen.indicator matched
CZ1jLe2nHENdGQX377    10.6.27.102    10.6.27.1    smart-fax.com    Intel::DOMAIN    
C044Ot1OxBt8qCk7f2    10.6.27.102    107.180.50.162    smart-fax.com    Intel::DOMAIN 
```

The above output shows that Zeek detected the listed domain and created the intel.log file. This is one of the easiest ways of using the intelligence framework. You can read more on the intelligence framework [here](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/intel.html) and [here](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/scripts/base/frameworks/intel/main.zeek.html#type-Intel::Type).

-----------------------------------------------------------

Each exercise has a folder. Ensure you are in the right directory to find the pcap file and accompanying files. **Desktop/Exercise-Files/TASK-8**

Investigate the `case1.pcap` file with `intelligence-demo.zeek` script.

#### Investigate the intel.log file. Look at the second finding, where was the intel info found?

Hint: Re-run the Zeek and the script if you don't see the "intel.log" file.

### Task 9 - Zeek Scripts | Packages

#### Scripts 204 | Package Manager

Zeek Package Manager helps users install third-party scripts and plugins to extend Zeek functionalities with ease. The package manager is installed with Zeek and available with the `zkg` command. Users can install, load, remove, update and create packages with the `zkg` tool. You can read more on and view available packages [here](https://packages.zeek.org/) and [here](https://github.com/zeek/packages). Please note that **you need root privileges** to use the `zkg` tool.

Basic usage of zkg;

|Command|Description|
|----|----|
|`zkg install package_path`|Install a package. Example (zkg install zeek/j-gras/zeek-af_packet-plugin).|
|`zkg install git_url`|Install package. Example (zkg install `https://github.com/corelight/ztest`).|
|`zkg list`|List installed package.|
|`zkg remove`|Remove installed package.|
|`zkg refresh`|Check version updates for installed packages.|
|`zkg upgrade`|Update installed packages.|

There are multiple ways of using packages. The first approach is using them as frameworks and calling specific package path/directory per usage. The second and most common approach is calling packages from a script with the "@load" method. The third and final approach to using packages is calling their package names; note that this method works only for packages installed with the `zkg` install method.

Packages | Cleartext Submission of Password

Let's install a package first and then demonstrate the usage in different approaches.

**Note**: The package is installed in the given VM.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zkg install zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass
The following packages will be INSTALLED:
  zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass (master)
Proceed? [Y/n] Y
Installing "zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass"
Installed "zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass" (master)
Loaded "zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass"

ubuntu@ubuntu$ zkg list
zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass (installed: master) - Sniffpass will alert on cleartext passwords discovered in HTTP POST requests
```

The above output shows how to install and list the installed packages. Now we successfully installed a package. As the description mentions on the above terminal, this package creates alerts for cleartext passwords found in HTTP traffic. Let's use this package in three different ways!

```bash
### Calling with script
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -Cr http.pcap sniff-demo.zeek 

### View script contents
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat sniff-demo.zeek 
@load /opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/zeek-sniffpass

### Calling from path
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -Cr http.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/zeek-sniffpass

### Calling with package name
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -Cr http.pcap zeek-sniffpass 
```

The above output demonstrates how to execute/load packages against a pcap. You can use the best one for your case. The `zeek-sniffpass` package provides additional information in the `notice.log` file. Now let's review the logs and discover the obtained data using the specific package.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat notice.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h proto note msg
10.10.57.178    44.228.249.3    tcp    SNIFFPASS::HTTP_POST_Password_Seen    Password found for user BroZeek
10.10.57.178    44.228.249.3    tcp    SNIFFPASS::HTTP_POST_Password_Seen    Password found for user ZeekBro
```

The above output shows that the package found cleartext password submissions, provided notice, and grabbed the usernames. Remember, in TASK-5 we created a signature to do the same action. Now we can do the same activity without using a signature file. This is a simple demonstration of the benefit and flexibility of the Zeek scripts.

Packages | Geolocation Data

Let's use another helpful package called `geoip-conn`. This package provides geolocation information for the IP addresses in the `conn.log` file. It depends on "**GeoLite2-City.mmdb**" database created by MaxMind. This package provides location information for only matched IP addresses from the internal database.

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -Cr case1.pcap geoip-conn

ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat conn.log | zeek-cut uid id.orig_h id.resp_h geo.orig.country_code geo.orig.region geo.orig.city geo.orig.latitude geo.orig.longitude geo.resp.country_code geo.resp.region geo.resp.city                                                  
Cbk46G2zXi2i73FOU6    10.6.27.102    23.63.254.163    -    -    -    -    -    US    CA    Los Angeles
```

Up to now, we've covered what the Zeek packages are and how to use them. There are much more packages and scripts available for Zeek in the wild. You can try ready or third party packages and scripts or learn Zeek scripting language and create new ones.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Each exercise has a folder. Ensure you are in the right directory to find the pcap file and accompanying files. **Desktop/Exercise-Files/TASK-9**

Investigate the `http.pcap` file with the `zeek-sniffpass` module.

#### Investigate the notice.log file. Which username has more module hits?

```bash
ubuntu@ip-10-10-29-118:~/Desktop/Exercise-Files/TASK-9/cleartext-pass$ zeek -C -r http.pcap zeek-sniffpass
